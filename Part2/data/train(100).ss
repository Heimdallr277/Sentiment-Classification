ur2480402/		\tt0119485		10		i excepted a lot from this movie , and it did deliver . <sssss> there is some great buddhist wisdom in this movie . <sssss> the real dalai lama is a very interesting person , and i think there is a lot of wisdom in buddhism . <sssss> the music , of course , sounds like because it is by philip glass . <sssss> this adds to the beauty of the movie . <sssss> whereas other biographies of famous people tend to get very poor this movie always stays focused and gives a good and honest portrayal of the dalai lama . <sssss> all things being equal , it is a great movie , and i really enjoyed it . <sssss> it is not like taxi driver of course but as a biography of a famous person it is really a great film indeed . 
ur2480402/		\tt0109836		1		this movie is not worth seeing . <sssss> has no merits what so ever . <sssss> does not make sense . <sssss> a total waste of time . <sssss> i don ´ t know why brannagh bothered to try and make this . <sssss> de niro is a joke as the monster . <sssss> read a horror story instead of this exploitation of viewers . <sssss> simply not worth our time . 
ur2480402/		\tt0093177		10		this is a truly remarkable horror movie . <sssss> although difficult to watch , especially twice , when you ´ ve realized how mean and groundbreaking it is . <sssss> the story is like ingmar bergman combined with the most sublime horror . <sssss> very surprising . <sssss> a truly astonishing vision . <sssss> clive barker is a most remarkable and visionary person . <sssss> although a movie like `` the ring '' -lrb- japanese version -rrb- is more convincing , this movie really astonishes on its own term . <sssss> it is the story behind which is so truly amazing , and you bring this out of the experience - that is , you remember the vision long after having seen this movie . <sssss> the sequal is not bad either , although the story is a bit worse . <sssss> many further sequels are completely useless though .

ur2480402/		\tt0185937		10		this is a brilliant horror movie . <sssss> fans of the genre knows this . <sssss> the reason there has been so much criticism of the movie is that non-horror fans where lured to see it as a semi-documentary ! <sssss> this is pretty naive or course , i mean to think that it is reality ... !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <sssss> ... ... -lsb- this note was found in the woods last year -rsb-

ur2480402/		\tt0372183		10		this is a super-cool movie . <sssss> * minor spoilers ahead * i just think the movie basically is a one-man show for to show how cool and super-human he is . <sssss> therefore i would give it 9/10 and not 10/10 . <sssss> it 's a good story , state-of-the-art action and suspense , etc. , however i still think it 's pretty silly judging it from outside its genre . <sssss> surely there is no reason to use tax-payers money on all this silly stuff . <sssss> i really like the scene where is in moscow and he steals the vodka , and drinks from the bottle while beating up police . <sssss> this is awesome stuff that indiana jones would have been proud of . <sssss> it really reminded me of some of my own traveling around the world . <sssss> moreover , the woman he meets in is really cute and hot-looking ! <sssss> just my type . <sssss> speaking of action-suspense movies `` man on fire '' is probably slightly better than this movie , which , as i 've said , is mostly just play for the gallery . 
ur2480402/		\tt0416449		4		i saw this again and it occurred to me what a disaster the whole subplot with the queen and all that is . <sssss> that story is not in miller 's original comic book and it really is quite horrible in the movie . <sssss> it is quite a shame because if that had not been there it would have been an excellent movie . <sssss> it is a bit like with watchmen : some of it is ok , and some of it is a total disaster . <sssss> i would like to see a cut of 300 where there was only the good things . <sssss> it is really quite a shame that a pointless subplot that has nothing to do with the battle has been cut into the movie . <sssss> anyway , that is what i wanted to say . <sssss> i think it is a good movie but i would not want to watch it again because it is only like 50 % of the scenes that are good . 
ur2480402/		\tt0190332		1		crouching tiger , hidden dragon is such a bad movie . <sssss> the love stories don ´ t make sense at all . <sssss> the cute princess is so annoying . <sssss> the violence does not make any sense either . <sssss> all in all a perfectly pointless movie . <sssss> why should we care about these stupid characters who act in such meaningless ways ? 
ur2480402/		\tt0075930		10		this movie is severely underrated . <sssss> it is totally awesome . <sssss> i have never been able to forget it . <sssss> * spoiler * the ending where he says `` god told me to '' is just amazing and equals the of planet of the apes . <sssss> it is an imaginative and eerie sci-fi horror-movie . <sssss> larry cohen has a b-movie integrity which is unique in film-making . <sssss> i also really likes his other movies and would highly recommend them to people who appreciates human dignity and the movies of david cronenberg . <sssss> `` it 's alive '' is just very scary and definitely not a movie to watch with your pregnant girlfriend . <sssss> the other movie about murder in hollywood , i 've forgot the title , is just awesome as well and never leaves your memory . <sssss> the same goes for `` q '' which is probably one of his most normal movies , and the effects in that one do seem a bit out-dated today . 
ur2480402/		\tt0088011		10		this is a great movie ! <sssss> it is so funny . <sssss> the love-story is excellent ! <sssss> i saw this movie when i was a kid and saw it again the other day . <sssss> it ´ s just as good . <sssss> robert zemeckis has made a wonder of an 80s movie . <sssss> it ´ s just superb . <sssss> watch it ! <sssss> watch it ! <sssss> watch it ! <sssss> highly recommended a long with a movie like raiders of the lost ark . <sssss> . 
ur2480402/		\tt0101757		8		i thought this was a very funny movies in the 80s style although it was finished in 1991 . <sssss> perhaps the title is a bit stupid and difficult to remember . <sssss> christina applegate is really beautiful and all things considered i thought this movie gave a good picture of how it is like to make it on your own without the support of grownups . <sssss> something i am still trying to do at the age of almost 32 , ha ha . <sssss> sue ellen 's boyfriend is almost holden in his outlook on life and all in all this movie is a great view into a time before the home computer got customary , internet , cell phones and so forth . <sssss> moreover , the old lady who plays the babysitter is really funny : - -rrb- 
ur2480402/		\tt1179904		10		i just saw this tonight in the cinema , and a lot of young people were screaming a lot and were quite affected by this movie . <sssss> it is indeed very effective . <sssss> the special effects are very good . <sssss> i thought , perhaps , the acting was a bit weak , but it is more than made up for by amazing effects where you keep thinking : `` how did they do it ? '' <sssss> however , this is more like a real film which has been edited so the whole blair witch thing seems to be something else . <sssss> this can not have been the couple 's camera that we did see . <sssss> anyway , the whole thing is very much like a even referring to monty python 's holy grail , i think , at one point mikah says : `` what is your quest ? <sssss> what is your favorite color '' or something like that , clearly a reference to monty python 's famous movie . <sssss> , the whole thing is very intertextual and actually quite funny but also quite moving and scary . <sssss> highly recommended , especially for fans of fantasy and the occult . 
ur2480402/		\tt0120841		4		i just saw this , and i was amazed at how poor it is . <sssss> some scenes were ok , but overall it just did not hang together . <sssss> when the fantasy genre has descended into this it is not a good sign . <sssss> basically these movies are just an excuse for showing sex and violence and other distressing scenes on-screen . <sssss> for example , the attempted rape by patrick was distressing to watch . <sssss> there is no story anyway so why not just focus on the monsters and the effects but naturally in these movies there is a lot of stupid dialogue and superfluous scenes . <sssss> if you are a fan of the series this entry is probably ok , but in the overall fantasy genre it does not rate very highly . 
ur2480402/		\tt0181536		1		this movie , which is a strange copy , of the far better good will hunting is probably the most inept movie about literature thus far . <sssss> it basically gets everything wrong , and it is hard to go into details about here . <sssss> obviously the producers have counted on an audience who does not care about literature anyway , so why not just ridicule it - that might be more in the taste of the audience . <sssss> moreover , the story is so so inept and without meaning or purpose . <sssss> good will hunting is not a perfect movie but it , at least , had some psychological credibility . <sssss> finding forrester has about as much credibility as ghost busters . 
ur2480402/		\tt0280609		3		i had looked forward to seeing this one . <sssss> however , i found it extremely hard to watch . <sssss> the werewolves look good . <sssss> they look very good . <sssss> although there is n't a complete transformation scene the special effects are quite good . <sssss> it was the characters and story that i had a problem with . <sssss> * spoiler * towards the end there 's a good scene where the female lead , a very cute , beautiful woman , exposes her identity as a werewolf . <sssss> that was a very good scene . <sssss> i fail to follow all the themes though . <sssss> what relevance does that have to the horror genre ? <sssss> someone compared this to evil dead and that is completely wrong . <sssss> the characters of evil dead are not soldiers . <sssss> in the end , dog soldiers is just another run-of-the-mill werewolf movie . <sssss> we have yet to see a perfect werewolf film in the history of cinema . 
ur2480402/		\tt0450278		10		i was one of those who did n't like `` cabin fever '' but i must say i was pleasantly surprised about `` hostel '' . <sssss> i all ready knew the plot : -lrb- spoiler alert !!!! <sssss> -rrb- : which is : travel , sex , porn , torture , escape , revenge . <sssss> it is a bad plot but one does not view such movies for the plot but for the effect and the suspense . <sssss> this movie is one of the most suspenseful i have ever seen . <sssss> it 's true that the acting is lacking at places , and also that there is no realism in the plot -lrb- spoiler alert again ! <sssss> -rrb- : these people have no motive to torture . <sssss> no one would pay to do this . <sssss> it 's true people torture each other for all sorts of reasons but not for the reasons in this movie . <sssss> it is very persuasive but still not realistic . <sssss> moreover -lrb- more spoiler alerts ! <sssss> -rrb- the notion that the last surviving guy just whacks off all his victimizers in a single sweep sort of meeting all of them on his way home is not realistic at all . <sssss> the way he escapes from the tortures is also pretty dumb . <sssss> why not just walk out ? <sssss> he had a gun . <sssss> surely it would not be easier to hide among the corpses and hope for the best while he was being transported somewhere . <sssss> anyway , this is surely a great movie about how rough europe maybe especially eastern europe can be ! 
ur2480402/		\tt0098273		5		i 'm watching this and i thought eh i 'll check into imdb and see the reviews and the ratings because i did n't get it . <sssss> there 's like no suspense in this movie . <sssss> sure al pacino is great but hey come on what is this about ? <sssss> it just does n't make any sense and i 'm not terribly excited about how it ends . <sssss> i 'm amazing al pacino did n't have anything better to do than stuff like this . <sssss> i do n't even know what to write in this review . <sssss> i just wanted to tell the readers of imdb that i 'm perplexed about this movie . <sssss> write me if you have a good comment or something on it . <sssss> yeah , well , i 'll watch now to see how it ends . <sssss> hope it will at least make some sense because what i have seen of it has not . 
ur2480402/		\tt1477715		10		i just saw this yesterday , and i must say it was a very good film . <sssss> michael jackson is very energetic and in good shape in the movie , so it is strange that he suddenly died . <sssss> in a way , his death reminds a bit of the death of bruce lee although jackson did not die as young as bruce did . <sssss> anyway , there is some great music in this film , and it is interesting to see jackson 's dance steps and updates to his songs . <sssss> for example he has added a big spider to his thriller song and some new lyrics also . <sssss> i am not a big fan of michael jackson but this movie really touched me , and made me wonder what happened to him . <sssss> anyway , this film is highly recommended . 
ur2480402/		\tt0384833		6		i bought this for the sum of 25 dollars in denmark , copenhagen where i am from . <sssss> that 's a pretty expensive dvd . <sssss> i can not say that i was greatly amused or pleased by the movie . <sssss> it 's just that when the latest `` anaconda '' clone comes out i 've just got to see it . <sssss> i guess this genre goes way back to the creature of the black lagoon which was a very effective movie . <sssss> certainly frankenfish is worth seeing for people who can not wait for the next `` congo '' or `` piranhas '' to come out . <sssss> the cgi in frankenfish is neatly balanced with non-cgi 's which should be the future of horror , i think . <sssss> for a little bonus there 's a hot asian and african-american women in this movie . <sssss> therefore , i must say , among other reasons , it is not at all bad . 
ur2480402/		\tt0328031		1		i 've just seen this film . <sssss> it is interesting i grant you that . <sssss> however , it is so sickening and disturbing that it 's really not worth it . <sssss> i was amused until it got to the torture scene . <sssss> then i quite simply turned off my television . <sssss> now i 've seen a lot of violent movies before -lrb- most of the classics -rrb- but this is really not worth it . <sssss> at least the `` torture '' / rape scenes in pulp fiction were funny and stylish . <sssss> this -lrb- in king of the ants -rrb- it has been done 1000 of times and in this particular movie the torturers have absolutely no motive or any motivation to act like they do . <sssss> none of the actors have acted in a way to make such brutal scenes credible in any way . <sssss> i fast forwarded through the rest of the movie , and it really broke down there . <sssss> i actually thought it was a good movie until the scene in the `` shed '' . <sssss> after that i think most people would lose interest . 
ur2480402/		\tt0889583		7		i expected a lot from this movie but it did n't quite deliver . <sssss> sure it is very funny and imaginative . <sssss> however , the character itself is not quite as funny as borat , perhaps . <sssss> but sure this is a very funny , and i really enjoyed it . <sssss> just like other comedies in the past sascha cohen is good at showing odd situations in a new way . <sssss> the movie is a lot about what it means to be gay or straight , and there is also a lot of sex and celebrities in the movie . <sssss> it is a bit like blair witch project because we realize that this is a fictitious movie and not a documentary . <sssss> moreover , the movie deals with brüno 's obsession with celebrities and what it means to be famous . <sssss> all things being equal , this movie is worth seeing but the borat character was perhaps even funnier . 
ur2480402/		\tt0222812		7		herbert west -lrb- jeffrey combs -rrb- is wonderful . <sssss> the other main actors are good too -lrb- especially the rat -rrb- . <sssss> that being said many scenes seem perfectly superflous , sadistic violence . <sssss> precisely the stuff a movie like `` evil dead '' avoids . <sssss> the story of re-animator iii is pretty good though - for a horrormovie , and there are absolutely wonderful moments of kitsch and funny references . <sssss> this would have been a 10/10 if not for some few extremely boring and pointless moments . <sssss> peter jackson ´ s two main -lrb- dead alive and bad taste -rrb- did not have moments like that either . 
ur2480402/		\tt0424136		1		this seemed like an interesting story but it is made in such a poor way that it spoils everything . <sssss> first of all , there is absolutely no justification for the so-called young woman 's actions . <sssss> only thing that would have made sense is if she had indeed been a supernatural being such as a ghost . <sssss> but making her into this against pedophiles is just ridiculous . <sssss> it does n't matter what jeff , who seems like a nice guy , by the way , has done , and this sort of behaviour would be impossible by a 14 year old girl . <sssss> both physically and mentally . <sssss> as usual us horror is trying to emulate japanese recent horror but fails miserably . <sssss> this movie hard candy looked like a haunting story but all ready about half an hour into the movie i could see that none of the actors or people involved in this movie was up to the task . <sssss> besides there is some strange speech that does not fit with the mouthes ' of the characters at all . <sssss> it looks very strange . 
ur2480402/		\tt0038854		10		i have not seen the new version but i must say i was very captivated by this one . <sssss> it must have inspired david lynch , since the bar is called `` twin oaks '' -lrb- twin peaks -rrb- , and i thought the story was really naughty and imaginative like a twilight zone episode and a hitchcock movie -lrb- but clearly different from hitchcock 's style -rrb- . <sssss> anyway , it is amazing that a movie from 1946 can still be so intense and interesting today . <sssss> i thought the movie has some interesting moral issues , such as whether it was ok to kill the old man from the viewpoint of ethics , because perhaps they had no other choice and something good could perhaps have come out of it . <sssss> i did not know the story . <sssss> i had just heard about the title , and i had heard about james cain , so when i watched it last night from 3 . <sssss> am , it was like watching an amazing and shocking dream unfold . <sssss> i guess , if one knows what is going to happen next it is not going to be as interesting . <sssss> anyway , this movie really seemed to appeal to me , and the situation i am in . <sssss> i am also 33 which must have been around the age of `` frank '' , the male lead character . <sssss> i think , the movie , as i have said , is more like a fantasy , also because of the scenes by the ocean , than a real crime story , so what we see here is really a story from the twilight zone , although a real twilight zone episode would probably have turned out a bit differently , such as frank waking up and discovering that in another dimension he had become the husband that they set out to kill , or something like that . 
ur2480402/		\tt0159097		1		i just saw some of this but i just had to turn it off . <sssss> it was simply too boring and meaningless . <sssss> obviously this is some kind of attempt at a criticism of `` society '' similar to , say , american psycho but in this movie it is just so pointless and boring . <sssss> i 'm pretty amazed by the positive review this movie has gotten . <sssss> it is really stupid and boring . <sssss> why would we show any interest in the fate of these persons ? <sssss> they do n't even seem like real characters at all . <sssss> the whole thing is so amateurish and insignificant that i can not believe it was released at all . <sssss> anyway , i did watch around 20 minutes of it and that was enough to judge it . <sssss> i did understand what is about but that is really not a good enough premise to make a movie on . 
ur2480402/		\tt0077362		10		i saw this one today . <sssss> it is a really great movie . <sssss> i don ´ t want to say much about it - just that jane fonda and jon voight are amazing . <sssss> it ´ s really a glimpse into another world - the world of the 60s -lrb- and 70s -rrb- which just doesn ´ t exist anymore . <sssss> i wasn ´ t born before 1976 - but it seems like a great time which is described in the movie . <sssss> the love-story is very , very touching and i feel grateful to have seen these great actors . <sssss> i ´ m sure all males in the audience felt like jon voight and all females felt like jane fonda . <sssss> man , it was so great ! <sssss> i can not say enough how much i the message and feel of this movie . <sssss> the music is amazing too with some good lyrics by dylan and stones . <sssss> it ´ s clearly an anti-war film but also clearly a film . <sssss> this is just so amazing . <sssss> they don ´ t make movies like that anymore . 
ur0217478/		\tt0131980		9		the last three movies steve martin has written - roxanne , l.a. story , and a simple twist of fate - were all based on what we think of as classics . <sssss> roxanne , of course , a modern day romantic comedy version of cyrano de bergerac , l.a. story was inspired by hamlet , and a simple twist of fate was a modern version of silas marner . <sssss> for bowfinger , however , martin goes to a classic `` showbiz '' story ; that of a guy on the fringe hoping for his one big break . <sssss> another contrast ; while those three films had some big laugh moments in them -lrb- like in l.a. story when we realize the message the freeway sign is spelling out -rrb- , we remember them more as films which make us smile and feel warm without feeling cheap -lrb- whereas , in my humble opinion , the father of the bride movies make you feel cheap -rrb- . <sssss> bowfinger , on the other hand , is a laugh out loud comedy like his earlier works such as all of me and dirty rotten scoundrels . <sssss> if i think roxanne and l.a. story are better films , it 's not because i do n't appreciate the laugh out loud movies , it 's just that those two are better made . <sssss> bowfinger has a few too many slow spots , and it 's not the masterpiece you 'd expect from the teaming up of martin and eddie murphy . <sssss> still , there are some huge laughs to be had here , like when murphy tries to cross the l.a. freeway . <sssss> and martin has a lot of affection for his characters , so you 're always laughing with them as well as at them . <sssss> also , it must be said murphy delivers one of his funniest performances . <sssss> everyone is raving about his portrayal of the sweet if clueless jiff , but i also liked his paranoid kit and his mantra of `` keep it together . '' <sssss> i always like heather graham and christine baranski , and it 's nice to see them here ; they play stock characters -lrb- and using imani coppola 's `` legend of a cowgirl '' is not , shall we say , the most subtle way of introducing graham 's character -rrb- , but play them for all they 're worth . <sssss> and terrence stamp is a hoot as kit 's new age guru . <sssss> all in all , very funny . 
ur0217478/		\tt0185125		9		is it possible to like a filmmaker even if you do n't like , or have never seen , any of their influences ? <sssss> certainly , pedro almodovar provides a `` yes '' answer to that question for me . <sssss> critics all over say one of his biggest influences is douglas sirk , director of movies like written on the wind , melodramas which i have avoided seeing since they usually star rock hudson , whom i 'm not a big fan of . <sssss> almodovar usually takes the melodrama form -lrb- some would say soap opera -rrb- and gives it a satiric twist . <sssss> when he likes the characters , as he did in law of desire and women on the verge of a nervous breakdown -lrb- still his best film -rrb- , the result is grand entertainment . <sssss> when he hates the characters , however -lrb- as in kika -rrb- , the result is dismal . <sssss> for some people , almodovar made a comeback with the flower of my secret , where he played straight what he normally played for satire , but i thought it was too much a soap opera to be affecting . <sssss> now he returns with all about my mother , and while there 's quite a lot of comedy here , it 's also played straight . <sssss> the difference here between this and the flower of my secret is the melodrama does n't seem tacked on -lrb- except at the end , which goes on a little long and gets a little unbelievable -rrb- , so the drama is affecting rather than tiresome . <sssss> also , the acting is far superior ; every one of the actors is quite good , but i think i liked the one who played the transvestite agrado the best , who seemed determined to stay happy , no matter what . <sssss> finally , i guess i can understand liking all about eve and a streetcar named desire more than i can understand liking romance novels -lrb- the occupation of the main character in flower -rrb- . <sssss> women on the verge of a nervous breakdown is still my favorite almodovar , but this is good as well . 
ur0217478/		\tt0115438		9		not much new to add here , except i enjoyed it . <sssss> yes , it 's a combination of pulp fiction and short cuts , but despite some slow spots , i really cared about all the characters , and so that made it worthwhile . <sssss> one thing i should mention ; i do n't remember who it was , but an actress or woman director pointed out that almost all fight scenes between women are in movies or shows directed by men , and they 're usually catfights . <sssss> this was directed by a man of course , but the fight scene between teri hatcher and charlize theron was , to my eyes anyway , realistically done , and no catfight . 
ur0217478/		\tt0119360		8		i saw this because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding scenes . <sssss> i read somewhere that oz and rudnick wanted to poke fun at liberal message movies , but the climax ends up being right out of one of those movies . <sssss> also , some of the humor is a bit on the cloying side , joan cusack was too over-the-top for me , and someone has a strange timeline re the oscars . <sssss> still , there were more than enough funny moments , like the kiss scene , the wedding that is n't , and the scene with the principal , to enjoy this . <sssss> kline as always is good , but for me , the real surprise was selleck , whom i 'm not a big fan of , but pokes fun at himself nicely here . 
ur0217478/		\tt0120891		1		i never saw the original tv show , so i ca n't compare , and i 'm willing to concede a bond-type show could work , but i know this much ; this movie does n't work . <sssss> the story drags on too long , the so-called gags are lame , some fine comedic actors are left twisting in the wind -lrb- only branagh held my interest for awhile , and i even got tired of him -rrb- , and it 's hard to believe barry sonnenfeld , who made the addams family movies and men in black so entertaining -lrb- not to mention get shorty -rrb- could make a stinker like this . <sssss> some nice photography by michael ballhaus , but that 's it . 
ur0217478/		\tt0117665		7		like the controversial book , the movie sleepers is divided into three parts ; before reform school , during , and after . <sssss> but whereas the parts in the book all worked together into a satisfying -lrb- albeit disturbing -rrb- whole , the movie only really catches fire in the last third , which is enough to recommend it . <sssss> before i get to why , regarding on whether it really happened ; that 's irrelevant . <sssss> it could have happened . <sssss> part one of the book , like the movie , establishes our protagonists and their personalities , as well as draw out the supporting characters . <sssss> we get to know and like them , and therefore the climax to the first part is quite disturbing . <sssss> the movie , alas , relies too much on voice-over narration . <sssss> a former friend once called movies like these `` narration from hell '' movies , and this one certainly qualifies . <sssss> it tells us , rather than shows us , about the main characters . <sssss> the four young actors are certainly appealing enough , but they 're left with nothing to work with . <sssss> perhaps because it 's so poorly written , jason patric , the one who narrates it , seems to do his job badly a la harrison ford in blade runner . <sssss> or maybe he 's just not good at it -lrb- he is a good actor -rrb- . <sssss> only the supporting characters , like de niro as the priest and the great italian actor vittorio gassman as king benny , come through . <sssss> part ii takes place at the reform , and it 's the weakest part of the book , simply because it 's all been done before , although this one is more sadistic than usual . <sssss> what helps the movie , besides keeping deniro around , is the performances . <sssss> kevin bacon is chilling as the head guard , and terry kinney , who usually plays weak-willed men , is surprisingly effective here as well . <sssss> part iii is the most controversial part of the book and movie , since it alleges a prosecutor threw a case , and a priest lied to help two murderers get off . <sssss> also , like a time to kill , it raises the question of whether revenge killing is justified . <sssss> unlike a time to kill , however , this movie and book do n't take the easy way out , but look at both sides . <sssss> you may not agree with what the priest character does , but you ca n't say it was easy for him , and like the book , the movie implies a little shame for having to ask him in the first place . <sssss> and deniro 's performance here is excellent ; the look on his face when he hears for the first time what the boys went through in prison says a lot . <sssss> the third part is where the movie finally comes alive , even though that annoying narration is still there , because the actors have something to work with , and they work with it . <sssss> in addition to deniro and gassman , i 'm thinking in particular of minnie driver , brad pitt , and dustin hoffman . <sssss> driver and pitt have to suggest earlier involvement , and they do in their powerful scene together in the subway when she reveals she now knows what went on at the prison -lrb- her reaction when she finds out is also powerful -rrb- . <sssss> as for hoffman , one reason i am tired of courtroom movies and shows is the assertion that yelling is the only way lawyers examine people , and hoffman resists the urge to overact . <sssss> watch him particularly when he destroys kinney 's character on the stand , with a low but probing voice that nicely plays against his questioning , rather than blow it up . <sssss> and so , when the four main characters -lrb- along with driver -rrb- come together for the last time , you really feel the moment , more than you 'd suspect from the start . <sssss> it 's not a perfect movie , but stick with it and it is worthwhile . 
ur0217478/		\tt0118929		9		when i describe this movie to people , i always tell them if kafka had written comic books , he might have turned out something like this . <sssss> alex proyas proves the crow was no fluke with this visually dazzling film . <sssss> he convincingly creates a world we can accept and marvel at , and he never breaks the rules he sets up . <sssss> i missed the emotional connection i felt with the crow , perhaps because while rufus sewell does a good job in the main role , he does n't give us that connection . <sssss> still , i found it compelling viewing . <sssss> jennifer connolly does n't have a big role , but she adds to the level of weirdness we feel , since she has the most `` normal '' role . <sssss> i was surprised to find william hurt here , but he 's very good . <sssss> acting honors , however , go to kiefer sutherland , who 's better than he 's been in a long time . 
ur0217478/		\tt0120660		9		except for true romance , and beverly hills cop and the ref , i 'm not a big fan of either tony scott or don bruckheimer , respectively . <sssss> but this was a lot of fun and surprisingly thought-provoking . <sssss> the beginning was obvious and a little clumsy , and the climatic shootout was a rip-off of true romance . <sssss> plus , i did n't like the cheap gag involving the asian couple . <sssss> but other than that , i really liked this movie . <sssss> for one thing , instead of scott 's pyrotechnics overwhelming the movie , here they fit right in and added to the paranoia . <sssss> some people griped about the gangster subplot , but except for that shootout , i thought it worked well . <sssss> it was a legitimate excuse why smith 's character was n't clued in right away on what was happening to him , and made him look smart when he otherwise would have come across dumb . <sssss> i liked smith as well ; he 's becoming quite the actor . <sssss> it was also a nice casting touch to have twentysomething white males as the bad guys . <sssss> i especially liked barry pepper here . <sssss> voight was a better villain here than he was in the rainmaker . <sssss> but the real treat of the movie was hackman . <sssss> one of the better character actors of all time , and the way he and the film refer back to his classic the conversation is also very well done . <sssss> those glasses were a nice touch too . 
ur0217478/		\tt0117802		8		perhaps i would have loved this movie if i was more into the cocktail , or lounge , culture portrayed here . <sssss> i do n't mind retro , but this movement turns me off . <sssss> still , as a guys romantic comedy , this is good . <sssss> as one critic said , this works because it understands most romantic comedy takes place before boy meets girl -lrb- in that respect , this movie reminds me of diner , which was also a study of guys trying to relate to women , though that one was better -rrb- . <sssss> unlike many , i thought the answering machine scene went on too long , but otherwise , i liked favreau -lrb- as everyone else pointed out , who ca n't identify with him ? <sssss> -rrb- , and of course liked vaughan a lot . <sssss> and i loved the resevoir dogs and goodfellas parodies , and of course that final scene is a classic . 
ur0217478/		\tt0181875		10		there 's a -lrb- by now -rrb- well-known scene early on in almost famous when william miller is poring through the records his older sister anita has left behind for him since she ran off from home . <sssss> inside the album cover of the who 's tommy , she leaves william a note , telling him to listen to this with a candle lit , and he 'll be able to see his future . <sssss> he puts on the record , `` sparks '' comes on , and the look on his face as he listens is the look every rock fan will recognize . <sssss> there 's been tons of stuff written about rock-n-roll music , from those who think , like william 's mother elaine , that it 's a corrupting influence -lrb- or those who go even farther and consider it `` the devil 's music '' -rrb- , to those who insist the music is meaningless and to take it seriously smacks of pretension , because it 's `` only music . '' <sssss> and then there are people like cameron crowe , who recognize rock-n-roll , and the music which came in its wake , is the shared experience of many people starting from the 1950 's , in the way maybe that plays and earlier types of music were in centuries before . <sssss> sure , there 's television and movies as well , but rock music is shorter and more direct . <sssss> and sure , it can just be fun and a way to cut loose once in a while , but it 's also something which can speak to what we love , what we long for , what we 're afraid of , what we think , what wounds us inside , and so much more . <sssss> because crowe is a fan , he 's able to capture all of this in his movie . <sssss> it 's not just in the obvious moments , like the people on the tour bus singing along to elton john 's `` tiny dancer , '' which lifts them out of their black mood , or singer jeff bebe leading everybody into singing `` on the cover of rolling stone '' when he learns he and his fellow bandmates will be on the cover . <sssss> it 's in the wild spirit of people like sapphire , one of the band-aids -lrb- read : groupies -rrb- who follow the band stillwater and others as they tour the u.s. , or in the more tender spirit of someone like her sister band-aid penny lane , who believes she and the other band-aids serve as a muse to bands like stillwater , and who soaks in all of her experiences like a sponge . <sssss> it 's also in william , who tries -lrb- like crowe did -rrb- to balance reporting with his very obvious love for the music . <sssss> and it 's especially in the line i quoted from at the top , which sapphire says to stillwater guitarist russell hammond late in the movie . <sssss> to be sure , the road of rock-n-roll is n't all covered in roses . <sssss> there 's outrageous behavior -lrb- like how russell treats penny , or william losing his virginity to three of the groupies -rrb- , drugs , excess , and yes , pretension -lrb- like when jeff lectures penny about the power of rock-n-roll and then adds , `` and the chicks are cool , right ? '' <sssss> but those who wanted this to be more like this is spinal tap are missing the point . <sssss> this is n't a movie about the obvious problems and silliness in rock music . <sssss> it 's about what still draws people to it , and though crowe acknowledges these people 's faults , he still loves them for who they are . <sssss> of course , there 's a lot more reasons why almost famous is a great movie besides its love of rock-n-roll . <sssss> it 's well acted across the board -lrb- in addition to all the performances mentioned several times , i 'd like to highlight fairuza balk as sapphire ; not only does she get the best line in the movie -lrb- along with frances mcdormand 's `` do n't take drugs ! '' <sssss> and `` rock stars have kidnapped my son '' -rrb- with that line about music -lrb- i also like what she and the other groupies yell as they 're about to deflower william , `` death to opie ! '' <sssss> -rrb- , but she also captures the carefree spirit of the time . <sssss> she may not be important plot wise , but if you took her character out , the movie would be missing something -rrb- , it 's a terrific coming-of-age story , it 's a bittersweet love story , the dialogue is great , and it looks terrific . <sssss> but it 's crowe 's obvious love for the music , and for the people who love it , that makes almost famous the best thing i 've seen so far this year . 
ur0217478/		\tt0115964		7		i suppose there are people out there who get turned on by accidents , especially car crashes , as there is something about sex in cars that 's a turn on . <sssss> and there have been countless movies about alienation that have been very good . <sssss> this , however , is n't one of them . <sssss> it 's not a bad film , because cronenberg is still a visual master , and some of that comes out , like the scene of the first meeting between spader and hunter , where she tries to get her seat belt off , and it 's almost like she 's aroused . <sssss> but the characters here seem like zombies all the way through , and you do n't get the sense that they want to feel anything other than dead inside , so it makes no sense that they 'd turn to fetish to escape feeling alienated . <sssss> the actors all suffer from this , except for rosanna arquette as a sort of den mother ; she 's the only recognizable human here . 
ur0217478/		\tt0118636		8		the original stephen king novella is one of the most disturbing things i 've ever read , and the movie approaches that power , but it never quite catches it , despite great performances by ian mckellen -lrb- who 's better here than in gods and monsters -rrb- and brad renfro . <sssss> a lot has been made of renfro 's character being older than in the book , but i did n't have a problem with that . <sssss> what i did have a problem with was we do n't sense , as we did in the book , how todd -lrb- renfro -rrb- is infected by dussander -lrb- mckellen -rrb- . <sssss> someone said how todd becomes like dussander at the end , but i felt someone felt nervous about king 's ending . <sssss> anyway , as i said , the performances are great -lrb- and i thought david schwimmer was fine , and i 'm not a fan -rrb- , and bryan singer has the same command of atmosphere that he did in public access and the usual suspects , but the story lets down at the end . <sssss> oh , well , at least suspects writer christopher mcquarrie is writing singer 's next film , x-men , so there 's hope . 
ur0217478/		\tt0120797		8		i am a huge fan of john cusack , even though he 's made some awful movies -lrb- better off dead , one crazy summer , fat man and little boy , and con air come to mind -rrb- . <sssss> this is not one of those , but it is disappointing after a great start . <sssss> he and billy bob thornton have a nice chemistry together , and they make their rivalry believable without overdoing it . <sssss> and thornton singing `` if '' and `` muskrat love '' has to be seen to be believed . <sssss> as the wives , cate blanchett -lrb- in a startling change from elizabeth -rrb- and angelina jolie are both fine ; blanchett at least has a character to play , more developed than you 'd expect , while jolie is forced to do a lot with a little , but she does . <sssss> and as he did with donnie brasco , director mike newell shows himself to be a good observer of human behavior . <sssss> but somewhere about the last 1/3 of the movie , it lost me . <sssss> i ca n't say exactly , but that 's when the movie decided to spell everything out rather than hint and observe . <sssss> and what the hell was up with that ending ? <sssss> overall , i do recommend it , but it 's not as good as i thought it would be . 
ur0217478/		\tt0082971		10		even if , like me , you 're not a connoisseur of old adventure movies or serials -lrb- i 've seen a few , but not a lot -rrb- , you can enjoy this movie . <sssss> spielberg and lucas , as one critic said , are not here making a demographic movie -lrb- which today 's so-called blockbuster movies are -rrb- , but a movie based on what they themselves wanted to see , and the result is pure entertainment from start to finish . <sssss> it 's inconceivable that anyone other than harrison ford could have played this part , and karen allen measures up quite nicely as marion , being much tougher than you might expect from this type of movie . <sssss> a classic ! 
ur0217478/		\tt0119314		8		like the novel of the bridges of madison county , this was a terrible novel -lrb- and this is about three times as long ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> where the movie of bridges was a complete rescue job , this is n't quite up to that level . <sssss> it 's too long , and the love story between redford and scott thomas -lrb- which , admittedly , was the part of the book which most made me want to gag -rrb- , was cut down , which was nice , but the result was there were n't many sparks between them , except perhaps when they dance together . <sssss> still , it 's a good film . <sssss> the rest of the cast is very good , particularly chris cooper and dianne wiest as redford 's brother and sister-in-law , respectively , and especially scarlet johanson as scott thomas ' daughter . <sssss> she took her character through the whole journey being convincing every step of the way . <sssss> three of redford 's previous movies as director -lrb- ordinary people , a river runs through it , quiz show -rrb- dealt with father/son relationships . <sssss> this is his first mother/daughter one , and i found it better handled than the love story . <sssss> redford and writers richard lagravanese -lrb- who rescued bridges -rrb- and eric roth were smart enough to infer , rather than state , that johanson 's getting better was tied in with the horse getting better . <sssss> the other thing i liked is , like in a river runs through it , redford evokes the west and at the same time demystifies it . <sssss> this is no `` tamed by the country '' movie , but rather rediscovering harmony with nature . 
ur0217478/		\tt0162661		8		it seems strange that i would be a tim burton fan , i think , because i 've seen little of the movies which influenced him as a kid -lrb- the old-style horror and science-fiction movies -rrb- and am more of a fan of narrative fiction than he is -lrb- i ca n't remember if i 've included this story or not , but here goes ; i read an interview where daniel waters , one of the writers on batman returns , talked about how he looked forward to writing burton 's first coherent narrative , only to be turned around by burton being the equivalent of obi-wan kenobi telling luke , `` use the force ! '' <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> but i think he 's funny , visually inventive , and has surprising depth . <sssss> i think he was the wrong person to do the batman movies , but i 've enjoyed all of his other movies , especially edward scissorhands and ed wood , which , by coincidence , both happen to be the movies starring johnny depp . <sssss> so it follows i was eagerly looking forward to sleepy hollow , their latest collaboration . <sssss> for about 2/3 of the way , this was good . <sssss> the look , as usual , was stunning , and he does a good job of creating tension , menace , and atmosphere . <sssss> the five character actors playing the town 's leading citizens -lrb- including burton favorite jeffrey jones , who appeared in beetlejuice and ed wood -rrb- add to that menace . <sssss> the sound of the sword alone was scary . <sssss> christina ricci does n't get a lot to do , but she does look lovely , and looks appropriate to the period and the town . <sssss> as for depp , this is a parody of sorts from him ; he 's applying the ichabod crane of the original story and playing him as if he really were a police constable -lrb- if he had played it straight , the movie would have felt wrong from the beginning -rrb- . <sssss> this is most apparent in the scene where he 's using gadgets to explain what is already obvious to the rest of the town . <sssss> the problem , however , comes when it 's time to wrap things up . <sssss> one of the screenwriters here is andrew kevin walker , who wrote seven . <sssss> that was a serial killer movie with a difference , which did n't follow a traditional formula , but was disturbing and original . <sssss> here , however , we get the feeling that he felt , despite burton 's attachment and the story 's horror roots , this was in essence a serial killer movie , and gave it a conventional ending . <sssss> in retrospect , without giving anything away , the ending is logical , but it hangs on a couple of details which are barely on-screen , and is handled so flatly that the movie bogs down , just when it 's supposed to excite us most . <sssss> also , some of the characters involved are so sketchy , the explanations about them feel last-minute to cover up weak parts of the story . <sssss> if someone had found a less literal-minded ending , i think that would have worked better . <sssss> as it is , it 's a good film , but it 's burton 's first non-batman film i 've had problems with . 
ur0217478/		\tt0116324		10		given that the 90 's has been an awful decade for straight comedies , labeling a movie as one of the funniest of the 90 's might seem like faint praise . <sssss> not to worry ; even if this was released during a good year for comedy , this would still be funny . <sssss> david o. russell proves spanking the monkey was no fluke with this movie , which may push the bad taste envelope , but unlike others -lrb- are you listening bobby and peter farrelly ? <sssss> -rrb- , knows bad taste alone does not a movie make . <sssss> you also need humor and people to care about , and this movie provides it in spades . <sssss> there are so many genuinely funny scenes here it 's hard to list them all , but my favorite would probably be when the fbi agent played by richard jenkins is accidently given lsd and takes a trip he never expected . <sssss> ben stiller and patricia arquette are the two leads here , and they do fine work , but the real treat is the supporting cast . <sssss> you might just dismiss the casting of mary tyler moore and george segal as stiller 's adoptive parents , and alan alda and lily tomlin as stiller 's real parents as just stunt casting , but they go beyond that to be funny . <sssss> moore is especially good as a pushy mom , being 180 degrees away from her tv image . <sssss> tea leoni is probably best known for a lousy tv sitcom , but she proved she had genuine comedic talent here as tina , the adoption agency worker . <sssss> as one critic up here pointed out , what makes tina funny is -lrb- 1 -rrb- she 's tall , -lrb- 2 -rrb- she 's clumsy , and -lrb- 3 -rrb- she has no sense of humor about either of those traits . <sssss> and what makes it work is she is n't self-conscious at all , but throws herself right into the character . <sssss> and finally , jenkins is quite a surprise ; though he 's a good character actor , i had no idea he was this funny . <sssss> all in all , hysterical ! 
ur0217478/		\tt0132477		7		when apollo 13 , which , to me , is still the best movie about the space program ever , came out , tom hanks said something which is still instructive . <sssss> he said the story was so good in of itself there was no need to go hollywood on it , and i wish director joe johnston had taken that to heart with this movie . <sssss> i read the book this is based on , and like this movie , it 's best when it focuses on the science part . <sssss> it 's careful and probing , and it does n't overwhelm you with jargon talk . <sssss> and you get to see the many mistakes before the eventual triumph . <sssss> but the rest of the movie falls a little short . <sssss> the sentiment was there in the book too , but it was n't as blunt as it is here . <sssss> there are too many cliches , and a few changes -lrb- like having the teacher being able to see the final rocket launch from her hospital bed ; in reality , if memory serves , she had already died -rrb- . <sssss> i guess i liked this movie , i just was n't inspired by it like others were , and like apollo 13 inspired me . 
ur0217478/		\tt0116695		10		cameron crowe is one of my favorite filmmakers after only three films to his credit as director -lrb- he also wrote fast times at ridgemont high , which was a little rough around the edges but still good , and the wild life , which was a huge mistake -rrb- . <sssss> say anything and singles were classics , and now comes jerry maguire , which is the first time he 's made a film about people his age or around that . <sssss> it manages to avoid being cynical and at the same time avoid being saccharine in its tale of a sports agent named jerry maguire who , thanks to a memo -lrb- or mission statement -rrb- that came from a brief bout of conscience , loses his job and his fiancee , and must not only claw himself back but admit to himself that he did in fact write that memo and really does believe in it . <sssss> tom cruise has spent half of his career coasting , and half of it giving great performances when he works with a real director . <sssss> this fits in the latter category . <sssss> as the script shows jerry 's growth in small steps , so does cruise . <sssss> it 's not until he really has grown and has something to lose -lrb- his marriage -rrb- that he has a big emotional scene at the end , and this feels earned , rather than cheap , as it does in so many other movies . <sssss> and while he is the star here , cruise does n't horn in on everyone else , but really plays off of everyone else , and even allows them room to steal the movie . <sssss> as for the rest , a lot has been said about cuba gooding jr. , and among the people who were nominated for best supporting actor , he would get my vote . <sssss> he also felt honest and was funny and energetic . <sssss> and the rest of the cast is good as well . <sssss> but the real force , for me , anyway , came from renee zellweger . <sssss> i think it was gene siskel who said he felt the movie might have started out being more about sports , but when zellweger was cast , it was shifted towards her character more simply because she lights up the screen . <sssss> now , from what i 've read , i do n't think the movie was edited towards her , but she certainly does light up the screen . <sssss> she has the two best moments of the movie ; when she finds out jerry 's dumped his fiancee , the look on her face is incredible , and i also loved her line to jerry after his big speech near the end , `` you had me at hello . '' <sssss> a great moment in a great movie . 
ur0217478/		\tt0120791		1		most of the bad adaptations this decade have been thrillers -lrb- like the juror -rrb- , but there have been others to creep through , like striptease , a very funny novel made into a painfully unfunny movie , and this one . <sssss> i was n't expecting to like the alice hoffman novel this movie is based on , but it 's a wonderful work which lives up to its title ; it 's about magic , but less about the `` bubble , bubble , toil and trouble kind '' -lrb- though there is some of that -rrb- than the magic that is in everyday life , and everything is grounded in some kind of reality . <sssss> and all four main characters -lrb- sally , her sister gillian , and her two daughters kylie and antonia -rrb- are well drawn and ones you care about . <sssss> the movie , on the other hand , is awful . <sssss> all the delicacy , subtlety , nuance , and especially the human quality are thrown right out the window . <sssss> instead , director griffin dunne and writers adam brooks , akiva goldsman , and robin -lrb- though goldsman has by far the worst track record , so i 'd like to believe he 's the most responsible -rrb- substitute your standard witches story , and while they keep some of the plot of the novel , it makes no sense when thrown in with this rubbish . <sssss> the look of the film is all wrong ; we even look like we 're in a cheap horror movie . <sssss> you do n't get much sense of the characters , or of them being capable of anything -lrb- in the novel , after her husband dies , and after she spends a year being miserable , sally leaves ; here , she just stays , why ? <sssss> cause it 's the idiot plot -rrb- . <sssss> and while bullock and kidman deserve credit for trying to mine something out of this -lrb- bullock is the most successful here -rrb- , dianne wiest is lost , stockard channing is uncharacteristically awful -lrb- she must have had some reason to channel bette davis , but damned if i know it -rrb- , and aidan quinn looks like he 'd rather be somewhere else -lrb- who could blame him ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> plus , he does a lousy southern accent . 
ur0217478/		\tt0115751		6		first off , i must say i agree 100 % with the praise of emily watson here . <sssss> she has an emotional nakedness few established actresses get to , and this is only her first film . <sssss> when she feels an emotion , it 's like her entire body acts on it , and you never catch her `` acting . '' <sssss> she 's shown in later movies like the boxer and hilary and jackie that her performance here is no fluke . <sssss> however ... i did n't like this film . <sssss> admittedly , though a catholic , i 'm a skeptic , and any film which takes seriously the mystical parts of religion makes me duck for cover , but this film is ridiculous . <sssss> not only that , it 's smarmy in how it asks bess , the heroine , to whore herself for her husband , and claims that she 's doing it for god . <sssss> i 'm sorry , but i found that offensive . <sssss> i was n't bothered by lars von trier 's technique -lrb- though i 'm amused at the dogma he and other filmmakers have created from this and similar films -rrb- , just the subject matter . 
ur0217478/		\tt0120647		5		maybe i 'm the wrong audience for disaster movies , but after this , i can safely say until it shows up on tv , i 'm not going to even bother with armageddon . <sssss> the special effects , of course , were good , but the movie was melodramatic and unconvincing . <sssss> it 's as if director mimi leder , who did a good job in her previous film , the peacemaker , was making up for the lack of emotional hooks of that film . <sssss> unlike , say , independence day , there was no bad acting , just wasted performances ; you 're left wondering why freeman -lrb- who merely declaims -rrb- , redgrave , and schell even bothered , and the teen romance subplot had no place here . <sssss> leoni brought much-needed quirkiness , and duvall was effective as always , but that 's not enough 
ur0217478/		\tt0120863		10		i read the james jones novel this was based on about a year ago , and after seeing the movie , i intend to read it again to see how it compares . <sssss> i can understand how many people have walked out saying `` what the hell was that ? '' <sssss> for me , however , it was quite powerful . <sssss> i 've never seen a terrence malick film before , but i was overcome by a lot of the images here . <sssss> not just the war ones either ; the image i most remember from the film is the shot of miranda otto -lrb- as ben chaplin 's wife -rrb- on a swing . <sssss> this is not a linear plot movie , which always drives people crazy . <sssss> rather , it 's a mood piece , and a reflection on man 's relation to nature -lrb- and how war violates that relationship -rrb- . <sssss> this , of course , brings it to the land of `` nothingness of being '' movies , which normally drives me crazy , but i found it worked here . <sssss> the voice-overs were a little over-used , but other than that , i have no complaints , not even of the rather large cast . <sssss> james caviezel did a good job carrying the movie , and everyone else was good as well . 
ur0217478/		\tt0119256		9		this first film from paul thomas anderson shows the promise he would later fulfill with boogie nights . <sssss> the writing here is as sharp as it was in the later film , but it must be said as a director , he sometimes lets scenes go on too long -lrb- ironic that boogie nights , which is a longer film , is also a tighter one -rrb- . <sssss> the main connection between both films is anderson 's obvious affection for his characters . <sssss> also the relationship between sydney and john does n't turn out the way you 'd expect . <sssss> and anderson is to be commended for avoiding melodrama . <sssss> philip baker hall is one of those actors who you may not know by name , but when you see him you instinctively feel he 's right for the part , no matter how small . <sssss> this is one of his rare leading roles , and he 's perfect , showing the character 's success and also his loneliness , without sentimentalizing it . <sssss> john c. reilly is properly eager and naive as john . <sssss> samuel l. jackson is dependable here , and gwyneth paltrow proves she does n't need a british accent to give a good performance . <sssss> she and jackson should also be commended for backing anderson when he had problems with the studio . 
ur0217478/		\tt0119174		10		if you 're the type of person who comes to movies just for escapism , this is a good movie to watch . <sssss> it 's a thrill ride that always keeps you guessing , yet it 's enjoyable and keeps you glued . <sssss> john brancato and michael ferris were also the credited writers on `` the net '' , and like that underrated film , this asks the question ; what if everything you took for granted was thrown out of whack ? <sssss> another way to see this is as the ultimate virtual reality movie . <sssss> and like any good director , david fincher turns the screws so subtly that by the time you realize he 's done it , you 're hooked already . <sssss> michael douglas , of course , has played so many yuppies he can do them in his sleep , but luckily he did n't here . <sssss> he even shows the man behind the facade here . <sssss> sean penn seems an unlikely choice , but he keeps you guessing . <sssss> one performer who gets overlooked usually is deborah kara unger . <sssss> her role may not be that big , but it 's certainly key , and the ambiguity she radiates fits perfectly with the tone of the film . <sssss> good character actors like james rebhorn and armin mueller-stahl also turn in memorable performances . <sssss> as for the ending , i can understand how some may have felt cheated , but i loved it . 
ur0217478/		\tt0120152		9		frankly , i was surprised at the amount of negative reviews this film received . <sssss> especially considering all the bad adaptations of good thriller novels this decade , this was quite good . <sssss> the main reason is that director bille august , writer ann biderman , and actress julia ormond do an excellent job of translating smilla from page to screen . <sssss> possibly the most unique heroine ever found in a thriller , smilla is a scientist and mathematician who 's unemployed because she trusts numbers and science more than she trusts human beings , and is rebellious against authority , even her father . <sssss> there 's nothing sentimental about her ; she even dislikes isaiah , the six year old boy whose death sets the plot in motion , until she finds in him a kindred spirit . <sssss> she 's single-minded , persistent , and aloof , and reveals herself not to those who she can trust -lrb- for she trusts no one -rrb- , but those she can relate to , like isaiah , the retired accountant -lrb- played brilliantly by vanessa redgrave -rrb- , and even tork , the villain played well by richard harris -lrb- although she becomes involved romantically with the mechanic , played well by gabriel byrne , she holds part of herself back , even before she finds out who he really is -rrb- . <sssss> and she even fights well . <sssss> i was very nervous about ormond playing smilla , because i did n't like her in legends of the fall or sabrina . <sssss> captives convinced me she was for real as an actress , but i did n't expect this . <sssss> she deserved an oscar nomination , for she fulfilled all of smilla 's qualities , and even did a convincing accent . <sssss> the movie is a bit disappointing when , after the halfway mark , it stops being a character study and becomes a thriller , but it 's still entertaining , and i hope this one has a shelf life . 
ur0217478/		\tt0115963		7		this movie really could go a lot further than it does , but it 's still entertaining . <sssss> where it could have gone further ; the relationship between catholic mysticism and witchcraft , though broached , is never really explained , and by focusing only on the four girls , we never get to see how they 're outcasts -lrb- except , of course , for sarah -rrb- . <sssss> how it 's still entertaining ; the effects do n't dominate the story , the fact that sarah has real telekinetic powers and the others are just wannabes is handled right , it never takes itself too seriously , and robin tunney and fairuza balk are both quite good . 
ur0217478/		\tt0116629		7		a friend of mine said that dean devlin and roland emmerich were n't trying to make a demographic movie , but were honestly trying to make the type of movie that would entertain them , a la spielberg . <sssss> that may be true -lrb- in fact , i 'm inclined to believe it is -rrb- , but you also need talent , and they fall short there . <sssss> the first half hour of the movie has problems which throughout -lrb- like randy quaid ; never is he more annoying or condescending than when he 's playing crazy types -rrb- , but grabs us at least , and i ca n't deny the visceral effectiveness of watching the white house being blown up . <sssss> but then the story becomes cliche city . <sssss> the only actors who survive are will smith and jeff goldblum , because they at least are entertaining . <sssss> some do solid work -lrb- harry connick jr. , robert loggia -rrb- , some are wasted -lrb- mary mcdonnell , bill pullman -rrb- , and some are awful -lrb- quaid , james rebhorn -rrb- , and the movie is similarly patchwork . <sssss> this movie does not represent the end of civilization as we know it , but it 's a sad state of affairs when this is the norm and not the exception . 
ur0217478/		\tt0120802		10		francois girard does it again . <sssss> like his last film , 32 short films about glenn gould , this explores the power of music -lrb- and though the subject here is classical music , it applies to all music -rrb- , in a non-conventional , yet compelling way . <sssss> the `` red violin '' is not the overwrought symbol it might have become in lesser hands , but the expression of how moved we are by music in so many ways . <sssss> the way it 's tied up to fate , passion , and , ultimately , life , is also well done without being pretentious . <sssss> it 's appropriate that the violin is used , for it 's one of the most basic of instruments . <sssss> the way girard weaves in and out of flashbacks is also well done . <sssss> finally , the performances are all good , particularly jackson as the collector . <sssss> i even liked mckellar in his small role , for while he 's a good writer , i 'm not a fan of his acting . <sssss> all in all , superb . 
ur0217478/		\tt0116996		9		except for his two batman films , i really like the work of tim burton . <sssss> sure , his scripts may not hold together , but there 's an appealing subversive streak of humor that appeals to me , and his visual talent is not slated towards beating us over the head with special effects , but with creating worlds that inspire us even if -lrb- especially if -rrb- we chuckle at them . <sssss> mars attacks ! <sssss> was not well-liked by many , but i had a great time at it . <sssss> the film may be intended as a tribute to -lrb- as well as a parody of -rrb- those cheesy 1950 's sci-fi flicks , but it also serves as a wicked satire of the disaster flick , exemplified that year with independence day . <sssss> obviously , the main attraction is those mars creatures , which , through a combination of stop-motion animation and computer graphics , are great to look at and provide several great moments in the film -lrb- especially when their heads explode -rrb- . <sssss> but the humans do alright as well . <sssss> sure , jack nicholson is one-note as the real estate developer -lrb- i 'm reminded here that when burton asked nicholson which part he wanted to play , nicholson replied , `` how about all of them ? '' <sssss> -rrb- , and natalie portman and danny devito are wasted as , respectively , the first daughter and a gambler . <sssss> but nicholson does good work as the president , glenn close is hysterical as the first lady , annette bening finally gets to play catwoman -lrb- so to speak -rrb- , and the cast is filled with people like jim brown and pam grier , who know enough not to take it seriously . <sssss> a lot of fun ! 
ur0217478/		\tt0120789		8		this film is a little overrated as far as i 'm concerned . <sssss> technically , yes , the transitions between black-and-white and color are tremendous and stunning to look at . <sssss> and the cast is excellent ; in addition to the two teen leads , i particularly liked joan allen -lrb- whose bath scene is one for the books -rrb- and jeff daniels -lrb- who remembers restraint here -rrb- . <sssss> and i hope marley shelton -lrb- she plays the girl in pleasantville who falls in love with bud -rrb- goes on to bigger things ; she 's beautiful and shows great acting promise . <sssss> but it just seemed that director gary ross laid it on too thick . <sssss> the climatic court scene had `` this is where we preach to you '' written all over it , and some of the other scenes did as well . <sssss> this is not to say this is a bad film , it just did n't wow me like it seems to have wowed others . 
ur0217478/		\tt0120744		7		i have n't seen any other three musketeers movies , and i could n't get through the dumas novel . <sssss> however , i liked randall wallace 's script for braveheart , so i thought i 'd give it a try . <sssss> wallace did such a good job combining historical fiction with old-fashioned adventure with a modern twist in that story -lrb- to be fair , mel gibson did a good job directing it -rrb- , but here , he 's not consistent ; there are some scenes and especially dialogue which are real clunkers , which alternate with scenes that are rousing or dramatic . <sssss> it 's not bad , but it just goes all over the place . <sssss> the acting reflects this inconsistency . <sssss> of course , a lot of the initial box office was due to dicaprio , and while i like him , and thought he was surprisingly good as phillipe , he was all wrong as louis ; not bad , just wrong . <sssss> amazingly , depardieu , perhaps the best actor in the cast , has almost nothing to do except clown around , and the lovely anne parillaud seems forced here . <sssss> irons has some good scenes , but is hampered with some of the bad dialogue . <sssss> the ones who rise above are byrne and malkovich -lrb- it 's nice to see him play something other than a bad guy for a change -rrb- . <sssss> it should be said that the swordfight scenes are all excellent . 
ur0217478/		\tt0119116		9		dumb does n't always have to be just dumb , you know . <sssss> there is such a thing as good dumb fun , and this movie provides it in spades . <sssss> the prologue was somewhat misconceived , though i guess it was necessary for plot purposes , but once things kicked in with the future , it was entertaining . <sssss> luc besson knows how to make entertaining junk food , as he did with `` nikita '' and `` the professional '' , and he does it again here . <sssss> for one thing , he takes the time to create a dazzling world that also makes sense . <sssss> it 's colorful , eye-popping , and visionary . <sssss> for another , while the story is pretty standard , it 's told with style , wit , and verve . <sssss> except for one or two over-the-top performances per film , it seems besson favors deadpan acting as a form of humor , and the actors here are well-suited to it . <sssss> willis can be monotonous in films like `` the last boy scout '' , but here , he 's got something to react to , and he does it well . <sssss> ian holm lends a touch of gravity to the film , as always . <sssss> milla jovovich is just fine as leeloo , playing as if things were just occuring to her . <sssss> the two over-the-top performances , of course , come from chris tucker and gary oldman . <sssss> i can see why some thought tucker annoying , but i thought he was funny . <sssss> but , of course , he was no match for oldman , who , as he proved in `` the professional '' , is an entertaining villain . <sssss> his voice -lrb- which he claimed was a cross between ross perot and bugs bunny -rrb- was even funny . <sssss> all in all , check your brain at the door and have a good time . 
ur0217478/		\tt0120601		10		though i had liked the few spike jonze music videos i 've seen -lrb- weezer 's `` buddy holly '' and the beastie boys one -rrb- , i was hesitant about whether he could make the jump to movies , for , as we know , for every good mtv raised director -lrb- david fincher -rrb- , there are several bad ones -lrb- michael bay -rrb- . <sssss> and this is truly a concept which could have gone either way . <sssss> but this is one of the most original , funny , and enjoyable movie experiences i 've had this year . <sssss> every idea pays off in ways you do n't expect , all four main actors do well cast against type , and it 's awfully hard to pick who 's the best -lrb- though i suspect john malkovich will be remembered at oscar time -rrb- , the dialogue is great -lrb- `` do n't stand in the way of my actualization as a man ! '' <sssss> may be the best line of the year -rrb- , and i ca n't think of another way to describe this except go see it now . 
ur0217478/		\tt0140352		10		before i start , i should declare my bias up front ; i have never understood the appeal of smoking . <sssss> granted , i did n't grow up during the time when it was made to look cool in the movies , but i do n't think it looks glamorous or stylish or any of that . <sssss> i can understand how some people will drink too much in that many alcoholic beverages actually taste good -lrb- i hope no one sees this as an endorsement of alcoholism , because it is n't -rrb- , but cigarettes do n't even taste good ; it 's just smoke . <sssss> i 've always liked this routine i once heard where a comedian talked about smokers and their attitudes : `` smoking does n't affect me , i can still exercise , '' they say . <sssss> then you walk up a flight of stairs with them , and all of a sudden they turn into darth vader -lrb- heavy breathing -rrb- . <sssss> meanwhile , there 's yoda on the railing going , `` stunt your growth , it will . '' <sssss> all that is to say i was predisposed to liking the insider before i even saw it , since it goes after the tobacco industry -lrb- anybody who thinks legalized drugs would improve things should consider how the tobacco industry has handled its own legalized drug -rrb- . <sssss> but if that was all it did , it would n't be a complete movie . <sssss> instead , the insider , and michael mann , also make this an indictment of the news industry , which is more concerned with industry than news , and a complex character study of two men . <sssss> admittedly , there are a few facts fudged here . <sssss> the most surprising thing is an omission ; i 'm not entirely clear on this , but was n't one of the cbs executives related to someone at brown & williamson ? <sssss> also , while it 's not true the movie gives credit to lowell bergman -lrb- al pacino -rrb- for manipulating a wall street journal story -lrb- he merely gives them the other side of the story they were about to print -rrb- , it does n't give the paper enough credit for its own investigation -lrb- as bergman in the movie points out , the journal is not exactly known for going after big corporations -rrb- . <sssss> still , this is a powerful movie . <sssss> one thing , as i said before , which makes it powerful is how it also goes after cbs , and in particular cbs news , for caving in to the possibility of a lawsuit -lrb- not a lawsuit , just the possibility of one -rrb- . <sssss> and while mike wallace has criticized the film -lrb- though he has retracted that somewhat -rrb- , the fact of the matter is if he had made a stink about it , cbs might not have caved in so easily . <sssss> and yet the film does n't portray him as a bad guy , just someone who does n't know if he has the fight left in him . <sssss> and as a character study , of course , it 's riveting . <sssss> some people think this film is a departure for mann from his usual crime dramas . <sssss> but mann has also made films about flawed heroes -lrb- manhunter , the last of the mohicans -rrb- , which jeffrey wigand certainly is , and like the characters in mann 's more famous films -lrb- thief , heat -rrb- , wigand is a man good at his job , but not good at expressing his feelings , and backed into a stand he did n't know he was going to have to take . <sssss> russell crowe has not always played characters with simmering intensity -lrb- think of proof , the sum of us , or the quick and the dead -rrb- , but as l.a. confidential showed , he 's masterful at playing them , and shows it again here . <sssss> he walks like a man defeated at the beginning , when he 's fired , and you can feel the longing he has just for things to be normal again . <sssss> but you can also see the intelligence and the man who refuses to be pushed around by anybody , whether it be the tobacco company or bergman . <sssss> pacino is also quite good as bergman , playing not a hero , but someone who also is pushed into a stand he did n't think he 'd have to take . <sssss> oh yeah , and as usual for a mann film , this looks incredible . <sssss> just as all the presidents men -lrb- which this is being compared to -rrb- director alan j. pakula and cameraman gordon willis was able to visualize the creepiness of watergate , here mann and his cameraman , dante spinotti , emphasize how there 's no black and white here by showing the gray areas visually . <sssss> all in all , this is a great film . 
ur0217478/		\tt0151137		7		i know next to nothing about the joan of arc story , but i 've liked luc besson 's work , and the trailer was terrific , so i was looking forward to this movie , even after the bad reviews . <sssss> as might be expected from a besson film , it looked incredible . <sssss> the battle scenes were all well-handled , and as the warrior joan , jovovich was quite convincing . <sssss> the rest of the movie was something else again . <sssss> it seems to me besson and his co-writer , andrew birkin , were trying to do what kenneth branagh did in his version of hamlet ; look at the lead character not as an icon , but as a normal human being , and try to explain their actions and behavior in that context . <sssss> admittedly , since i am unfamiliar with this story , i am more receptive to this approach than those who hold joan as an icon , but i would have been more than willing to watch a movie which handled this material well . <sssss> unfortunately , once besson established which way he wanted to go , he seemed unsure of how to get there . <sssss> most of the drama is handled on a third-grade level -lrb- especially her trial -rrb- , and we never really get into what made joan tick . <sssss> though the scenes with dustin hoffman were involving , especially since he was so good , they too fell short in explaining joan . <sssss> and jovovich ca n't quite access those depths yet . <sssss> the rest of the cast is okay . <sssss> malkovich and faye dunaway are playing types , but they play them well enough . <sssss> -lrb- i know i 'm not spelling that right -rrb- and vincent cassel lend a sense of gravity to their roles as soldiers . <sssss> but all in all , this is a movie whose reach was beyond its grasp . 
ur0217478/		\tt0119822		10		i 'm a big james l. brooks fan , so i was anxiously awaiting this movie , and though i preferred the original title -lrb- old friends -rrb- , that proved to be my only complaint . <sssss> brooks is one of the masters at combining comedy with drama , and he 's also great at writing dialogue -lrb- the `` noodle salad '' speech is a highlight -rrb- . <sssss> i should also say though i 'm not familiar with mark andrus ' work , he obviously deserves credit for writing the original script , which brooks re-wrote . <sssss> a lot has been said about nicholson , but let me just say this ; i have friends who work with obsessive-compulsive people , and people who suffer similar disorders , and they said nicholson captured what being an obsessive-compulsive is to a t. i also liked how gradual he changed , that his progress is slow , and that he still makes mistakes when he 's unsure -lrb- like when carol comes on to him and he asks her to sleep with simon -rrb- . <sssss> there also seems to be a backlash against hunt , and i for one would like to nip that in the bud . <sssss> a single mom is the type of role that other actresses might use to call attention to themselves , but hunt never does . <sssss> and again , she concentrates on building her character gradually as well , and making her recognizable -lrb- the fact that the only way she can thank the doctor -lrb- harold ramis -rrb- who helps her son is to hug him , even though they do n't know each other and he 's obviously embarrassed -rrb- . <sssss> finally , kinnear gives his first really good performance as simon . <sssss> all in all , an excellent film ! 
ur0217478/		\tt0068646		10		i first saw this film the summer before my senior year in college , during a summer school class i was taking called `` literature and film . '' <sssss> this was the second film they showed , i think , and from the moment the character of bonasera comes on and says , `` i believe in america , '' this had me hooked . <sssss> this is like the perfect meal , where all the ingredients come together - theme -lrb- gangsters as a metaphor for society , family being overrun by cold-hearted business tactics -rrb- , story , acting -lrb- brando seemed a little overrated when i first saw it , but that 's because he 's not on-screen a whole lot ; it took me a few viewings to see his shadow hangs over the entire film . <sssss> the rest of the cast is excellent as well , especially pacino -rrb- , the technical sides -lrb- the way gordon willis uses light and dark to contrasts the two sides of the corleones made me pay attention to cinemotography -rrb- , dialogue -lrb- `` i 'm gon na make him an offer he ca n't refuse '' `` leave the gun , take the cannoli '' -rrb- - and leave you completely satisfied . <sssss> and the scene i remember is not the horse 's head , or the scene where michael says he will kill sollozzo and mcclusky , but rather the baptism scene , which haunted me for days . <sssss> incredible as it may seem , part ii is even better . <sssss> but i 'll say more about that in those comments . 
ur0217478/		\tt0122541		7		comedy plays like those that oscar wilde are tough to do ; go one way , and it 's too smug and arch , go another and it 's too labored and drawn out . <sssss> adapter oliver parker avoids the first part but stumbles into the second . <sssss> obviously , in this era , he probably felt he could make a timely statement about politicians , and he handles that part without grandstanding . <sssss> but this is essentially a comedy , and while we start out brightly , the end slows it down to a crawl . <sssss> to be fair , it 's hard work to appear effortless -lrb- as cary grant proved -rrb- , but the comedy suffers because of it . <sssss> certainly rupert everett is effortless enough , and he 's not only good in of himself , but everyone else is at ease when acting with him -lrb- i particularly like his sparring with minnie driver -rrb- . <sssss> but while the rest of the cast is good -lrb- though northam looks uncomfortable at times -rrb- , they get caught when the movie slows down . <sssss> it 's too bad , because there are good things here , but as wilde might say , it talks more and says less as it goes on .

ur0217478/		\tt0053125		10		hitchcock always called psycho his `` fun '' picture . <sssss> it seems to me this film , which is my favorite of his , would fit that term better -lrb- though psycho , a great film , may have been more fun for him , because it was probably less of a hassle physically to shoot , and because it appealed to his warped sense of humor -rrb- , since this basically kids the genre he helped invent , the suspense thriller . <sssss> the plot , when you think about it , is a remake of his own the 39 steps , and although i 'm not a hitchcock expert , others could probably point out echoes of other of his films in this one . <sssss> at the same time , it still manages to be quite suspenseful . <sssss> cary grant was one of hitchcock 's favorite actors , and it 's easy to see why ; he lends a class and glamour to the film , yet allows himself to be put in all sorts of sticky situations which he is able to escape from , no matter how narrowly . <sssss> eve marie saint is one of the best leading ladies he ever had , generating not only sex appeal but mystery . <sssss> leo g. carroll is quite good as the professor , and i wonder if he was an inspiration for george smiley . <sssss> martin landau is slimy as leonard . <sssss> but besides grant , the best performance here is by james mason , who avoids going over-the-top to just ooze malice . <sssss> i especially liked his last line ; `` not very sporting , using real bullets . '' <sssss> there are so many classic scenes it 's hard to list them all , and bernard hermann 's score is excellent as well . 
ur0217478/		\tt0155267		9		a lot has been written , in this forum and in others , about remakes , and people probably feel the same way about them as they feel about cover versions of favorite songs . <sssss> though i 'm with the stereotype of the film lover in a lot of ways -lrb- i hate sequels , hate colorizing movies , prefer subtitles to dubbing -rrb- , i must admit i have nothing intrinsically against remakes . <sssss> one of my favorite movies of all time , no way out -lrb- the kevin costner movie , not the richard widmark movie -rrb- , is a remake -lrb- of the big clock -rrb- . <sssss> and i 've seen a handful of good ones over the years -lrb- i do n't count remakes of foreign language movies because the chances are usually slim that i 'd get to see the original -rrb- . <sssss> all of this , i guess , is a roundabout way of saying i enjoyed this version of the thomas crown affair , which is a remake of the famous 1968 version directed by norman jewison and starring steve mcqueen and faye dunaway . <sssss> i must admit i do n't think the original was a classic . <sssss> not to say i hated it , since i liked steve mcqueen , i liked the cinematic tricks jewison used -lrb- like the split screens -rrb- , and i liked the song `` windmills of your mind '' -lrb- and i 'm not a fan of alan and marilyn bergman , two of the songwriters -rrb- . <sssss> but i caught the strain at times , and while faye dunaway is good in the right role -lrb- chinatown , network -rrb- , her character was way underwritten , and she was forced to act girlish , which is not her best mode . <sssss> so ultimately , i found it okay but forgettable . <sssss> now the remake . <sssss> pierce brosnan , i must admit , suffers in comparison to steve mcqueen . <sssss> he 's got a movie star presence , and he effectively communicates the joy he gets out of high risk activities , like the boat racing and the airplane flying . <sssss> but mcqueen showed you the boredom which led crown to pull his heist , and brosnan does n't . <sssss> and mcqueen has more depth to him than brosnan does , so the strong , silent thing works for him better -lrb- although brosnan 's scenes with dunaway , who plays his psychiatrist , are fun , you know it 's a plot device to show the feelings brosnan ca n't quite access -rrb- . <sssss> on the other hand , the remake does improve on the original in some substantial ways . <sssss> as i said , i liked jewison 's direction there , but director john mctiernan makes it even sleeker and tighter here . <sssss> when people mention mctiernan , they usually mention he 's the director of two of the die hard movies . <sssss> more appropriate to this discussion , however , is the hunt for red october , another film he directed with a slick polish . <sssss> there , i thought it clashed with the good straightforward story and the fine acting , but here , it buttresses the story and the acting . <sssss> there is n't a wasted moment here , and the two heist sequences are quite cleverly done . <sssss> also , while i do n't really remember the detectives in the first one , denis leary is quite good as the detective here . <sssss> as in his best work -lrb- the ref , wag the dog -rrb- , he 's able to be denis leary within the context of the character , and i liked the fact that even though he played by the rules , he was n't a clod . <sssss> but the real improvement comes in the form of rene russo . <sssss> as i said before , when dunaway played the insurance investigator , there really was n't much for her to work with . <sssss> here , russo is shown thinking with her brain , and not just her hormones . <sssss> and instead of acting girlish , russo acts sexy in a very adult way , which is refreshing in this day and age . <sssss> and while , as i said , i had problems with brosnan 's performance , i think brosnan the producer was smart enough knowing a good thing when he saw one and allowing russo to steal the movie from him -lrb- i would like to know what that stuff she was drinking , though -rrb- . <sssss> in a summer full of disappointments from the major studios , this was a nice surprise . <sssss> if all studio movies were as much fun as this , hollywood would n't be in the trouble it 's in . 
ur0217478/		\tt0119485		10		as `` the last temptation of christ '' showed , martin scorsese is not a filmmaker interested in playing it safe when it comes to religion . <sssss> instead , he wants to get into the heart and soul of it . <sssss> while that film was obviously closer to his heart , since he was raised catholic , this one burns with the same conviction and passion . <sssss> the difference is he and writer melissa mathison adjust themselves to the way of storytelling needed to tell the life of the dalai lama . <sssss> unlike say , `` little buddha '' , though , where bertolucci seemed to have no sense of distance from his subject , scorsese does , so we are allowed to come to our own conclusions rather than having them shoved down our throats . <sssss> visually and aurally , this is also a real treat , with the images being more powerful than anything scorsese has done before . <sssss> and while the music here is old territory for philip glass , he produces a stunning score which should have won the oscar . <sssss> the mostly non-professional cast -lrb- i did see a familiar face here and there , but i ca n't remember them -rrb- also does good work . 
ur4751428/		\tt0307987		9		for a lot of reasons , `` bad santa '' finds itself near excellence during its running time . <sssss> it 's not difficult to explain how a movie becomes great , i always explain that when i watch a drama , thriller ... but comedy ? <sssss> a great comedy ? <sssss> it could be `` bad santa '' . <sssss> i have n't laughed so hard with movie situations since `` liar liar '' . <sssss> this movie has a way of creating laughable experiences no comedy uses these days . <sssss> i 'll go on to that later . <sssss> terry zwigoff has directed some movies ; a few . <sssss> but there are n't any movies , he directed recognized movies so he was recognized . <sssss> he took long enough periods between each film , but some may say it was worth to wait . <sssss> sometimes writer , sometimes director , zwigoff places his characters in their stories and begins to direct . <sssss> it 's not visually outstanding or beautiful ; but i just can say that it looks like everybody is listening to him and doing what he says . <sssss> at times he creates some long distance shots , as if he was a mere observer , just passing by . <sssss> and billy bob thornton 's story ... i was recently thinking he is one of the most important people in hollywood , and the story is quite interesting ; it began with a film called `` sling blade '' . <sssss> thornton wrote the screenplay and acted in the movie . <sssss> i heard he turned out to be outstanding at both jobs , so he was n't just in for the writing , he was in for the acting too . <sssss> he proved to me he could act , brilliantly , in `` the man who was n't there '' . <sssss> he proved to me he could write , with his script of `` the gift '' . <sssss> then he is no fool . <sssss> his character in the movie , however , is a fool . <sssss> a fool , a drunk , a sex fan ad ultimately a thief that works as santa in malls just to rob them with a partner , marcus -lrb- tony cox -rrb- , who is the elf . <sssss> plus , marcus is a midget and they can both be sure they 'll never be fired . <sssss> they are , alongside the kid -lrb- brett kelly -rrb- , the most important players in the film and they both swear a lot in some situations that give magic to the film and i wo n't reveal . <sssss> when has saying bad words been magical ? <sssss> i 'm coming to that , but just needed to say how thornton finds the note here . <sssss> how he shines throughout the ride , stealing the show with his lines , with his faces . <sssss> those faces that are not bill murray 's faces in `` lost in translation '' , neither jack nicholson 's known faces . <sssss> with his study of the character he invented his own faces . <sssss> his movements also ; it is everything . <sssss> he 's sitting in that santa chair and when a kid comes and asks for a present he does n't know , says : `` what the f ** k is that ? '' <sssss> . <sssss> he does n't care , and that 's great . <sssss> it is also great to wonder how serious the man can be with his work . <sssss> i 'd heard he had stopped smoking , and in the movie i see him always with a cigarette in his hands that i wonder if he was n't smoking all the time . <sssss> same thing with the drinks ... probably he walked drunk in the set . <sssss> after earning money from a robbery , his character says he 'll go to miami and manage a bar , when his partner believes he 'll be drinking to death and come back as soon as he is called . <sssss> then a camera shows him in the middle of a bar , as if he was running it , but as we get closer we realize he 's not . <sssss> glenn ficarra and john requa , the writers of `` cats & dogs '' , must be two intelligent men . <sssss> after a movie like the one they wrote before , you would n't expect something like `` bad santa '' out of their hands , but they created those magical bad words . <sssss> because , as i wanted to say all along , the script is so loyal to the reality of its characters that laughs come easily . <sssss> not like in other comedies , where they have to used forced elements to make us laugh ; disgusting excrement , bathroom scenes , stupid swearing ... it 's not good . <sssss> here , the loyalty ficarra and requa generate with their characters , with their main character , almost makes this comedy look like a character study ; like a drama or a character piece , although it is just another comedy . 
ur4751428/		\tt0481141		6		i honestly ca n't remember the last time i saw a good film on a movie theater . <sssss> my latest experiences have been `` wild hogs '' , `` ocean 's thirteen '' , `` harry potter and the order of the phoenix '' , now `` no reservations '' ; which is not a bad film , but like so many , is regular and pointless at times and it makes you wonder why it was done . <sssss> i do n't have the answer , but i do have more questions ; with no answers of course : why did catherine zeta-jones do it ? <sssss> why did aaron eckhart do it ? <sssss> and abigail breslin ? <sssss> and director scott hicks : why did he wait six years after the fantastic `` hearts in atlantis '' to do this ? <sssss> is there a problem with agents ? <sssss> luckily , i do n't have to blame them much because , during most of the time , all of the mentioned above did a good job . <sssss> at times , however , they -lrb- the actors -rrb- look tired and their expressions do n't seem so real . <sssss> it happened mostly with zeta-jones , but it also occurred to eckhart and breslin . <sssss> maybe they could n't believe what they were reading ; watching `` no reservations '' is to watch intelligent people speaking silly words and a therapist -lrb- a likable bob balaban -rrb- making some sense out of everything ... but the therapist does n't appear long enough . <sssss> we do n't have to forget that this is a remake and apparently carol fuchs could n't do much with her script , taken from the old one of sandra . <sssss> sometimes when a writer takes on an old screenplay , you can sense a certain amount of freshness and originality , even if you have n't seen the original film ; carol 's work is not the case . <sssss> there are a small number of comedies about love and cooking i like . <sssss> the one i always recall is `` simply irresistible '' , because it 's an irresistible movie even when it exaggerates things ... this i say it because `` no reservations '' sticks a lot to reality , with the help of breslin 's unique charm and naturalness and her instant chemistry with zeta-jones , and her chemistry with eckhart ; the elements that make the film watchable . <sssss> i 've got to say about eckhart ; he 's got a perfect way of creating completely different individuals in every film . <sssss> i was revising his work and he has been part of films i have seen but i do n't remember his presence in them ... and tell me something about that beard in `` erin brockovich '' . <sssss> here , he sings opera and jumps around in a state of eternal happiness ; and he 's more than contagious . <sssss> the other contagious thing i forgot to mention is the food ... my god ! <sssss> every dish looks amazing and you will spend the whole movie wanting to eat something . <sssss> but the place where they cook it is so not contagious . <sssss> in a simple production design , the kitchen where most of the movie takes place appears as empty as `` no reservations '' itself . <sssss> i did n't want a place with shining lights and special effects , i know people are making food ; but i felt i needed something a bit more exciting . <sssss> i have n't even said that patricia clarkson is in the movie ; but that 's because she 's completely underused . <sssss> oh , and phillip glass ' light score also has its moments . 
ur4751428/		\tt0081283		8		the industry loves robert redford ; they really do and they 've always have . <sssss> so when he directed his first feature , he had to be in the spotlight . <sssss> it 's not like he wanted to , but it was a matter of fate . <sssss> maybe scorsese 's fans still feel disappointed today and maybe this is is n't the greatest film in history , but it is at least a proof to show redford was a gifted director from the beginning and that he chose a very strong and interesting topic for his first piece : ordinary people . <sssss> the fact that the characters of the film are so palpable and human makes me think . <sssss> and it 's not the first time with this movie ; today , each time i catch a movie about real daily lives , i pay attention to all the elements : i want it to be real , because those are the films i like more . <sssss> when this picture commences , you can perfectly listen to a canon . <sssss> it is not original music , but even when there 's a composer , music is what this movie uses less . <sssss> the opening credits are also seen with the sky as a background , quickly , desperate for the movie to start . <sssss> the passion for making films can be felt . <sssss> now the story is being told , in the words of alvin sargent , screenwriter who based his thing in a novel by judith guest , and his adaptation is remarkable , because the tension can be felt , the chats do n't seem fakes . <sssss> there 's no intention of complexity or poetry in some words , but that 's exactly what had to be done . <sssss> i was eagerly thinking , although , in today 's screenplays of these type . <sssss> cameron crowe and his natural way to say things ; paul thomas anderson , when he does not try to be shakespeare ... . <sssss> good or not -lrb- very good for me -rrb- the story tries to show us what this family lives , with no special intentions . <sssss> it could have been any other , and this one sadly has very important issues to carry with . <sssss> when conrad 's -lrb- timothy hutton -rrb- brother die , he felt guilty , but he just does n't say it . <sssss> he knows that , and he also knows he is violent , boring and a little dangerous . <sssss> he begs for control and the one who 'll help him is dr. berger -lrb- judd hirsch -rrb- , during sessions of very well written talks . <sssss> sargent analyzes this relationship and the one con has with jeannine and other people comparing each word , each position , with cameras and settings . <sssss> and it does n't work only with conrad ; it works with the other main characters . <sssss> calvin jarrett 's -lrb- donald sutherland ; a fine performance but not as strong as the others -rrb- life involves friends reunions and encounters , his relationship with his younger son and the memory of the elder 's dead , and the most powerful element maybe of the whole film , his relationship with his wife beth -lrb- mary tyler moore -rrb- ; who also has to deal with her brother , her now only son and everyone in the society . <sssss> the screenplay does n't miss a thing , and hits hard when beth tries to talk with conrad outside , or when he tells her his good grade in a test , or the disturbing moment when cal wants to take a picture of his wife and son together , and she refuses to stand still , asking for the camera . <sssss> she ca n't hug her son for the photograph , her smile is faked . <sssss> with a lot of noise and movement that keep cal from taking the picture , conrad suddenly shouts : `` give her the f *** in ' camera ! '' <sssss> . <sssss> then there 's a family discussion about family caring : `` she never went to the hospital to visit , because she was in her trips to europe '' , conrad tells his father referring to beth . <sssss> `` but if buck had been there , you would have visited , right ? '' <sssss> . <sssss> so conrad goes quickly upstairs , but not quickly enough to miss his mother 's scream : `` buck would never have been in the hospital ! '' <sssss> . <sssss> because calvin cares for everyone , but beth fears that people finds out his son sees a psychiatrist ... see the difference ? <sssss> performances are key to the movie 's success , and although mary tyler moore carries the thing , the supporting portrayals highlight the most . <sssss> timothy hutton trapped focused driven representation of a screwed up kid is wonderful ; you can tell he 's trying to improve . <sssss> however , it is judd hirsch as the understanding psychiatrist the one who makes the best out of the screenplay for me . <sssss> he says everything fast , in the same tone of voice , like he did n't care ; and that seems easy . <sssss> but when the strength is required , he accomplishes magically . <sssss> redford 's camera is the other main character i did n't mention . <sssss> his first film already had elements he 'd repeat later in his few directed movies . <sssss> the golf this family played would be the central theme of the astonishing `` the legend of bagger vance '' . <sssss> the ones who doubted of his directing talent should also see the perfectly crafted `` quiz show '' . <sssss> besides directing the actors perfectly , because he is an actor , he makes the camera the important element not many care about . <sssss> so he places still shots , so the camera can wait for the characters and watch them do their life ... in conversations between two persons , he just shoots the face of each of them when they are speaking , he is studying the characters . <sssss> characters and life ... two words instantly related . <sssss> a lot of things happen in redford 's debut , including a conversation i feel tempted to reveal , but even if i spoke , it would be up to you . <sssss> it would be up to you to decide what each of the characters think , what they 've buried , what they feel , and most importantly ; why ... 
ur4751428/		\tt0137363		7		to say that you 're not going to forget a movie for the rest of your life does n't necessarily mean that the movie is good ; it could be something so awful you 'll never be able to get out of your mind . <sssss> well , in this case it does mean the movie is good : i 'm not going to forget `` arlington road '' for the rest of my life . <sssss> this is a compliment for a movie i had wanted to watch for a lot of years before i watched it some days ago . <sssss> why did n't i watch it ? <sssss> i do n't know . <sssss> do i regret it ? <sssss> big time , because i did n't find the movie as innovating as it seemed to be a long time ago , and consequently i did n't find it very good ; as i probably would have a long time ago . <sssss> is that i have seen so many movies of this type , you know ? <sssss> with a twist in the end and tension all the way through ... most of them were n't even good so i lost faith in the genre and its originality . <sssss> `` arlington road '' is a perfect example for a good film in the genre , which also combines various other elements and luckily develops its plot directly through the characters , when everything now is still making sense mostly through the actions . <sssss> ehren kruger , a very talented writer whose credits include `` the ring '' and `` the skeleton key '' , failed to make way for its mind-blowing conclusion in the latter film a couple of years ago . <sssss> but with `` arlington road '' , many years before , everything in her screenplay fit fine , making the conclusion more than satisfying and still mind-blowing . <sssss> the story about michael faraday -lrb- jeff bridges -rrb- a man still suffering because of his wife 's death and teaching a terrorism university course because she was an agent , while he deals with his troubled son ; `` arlington road '' begins with a breathtaking first scene full of film-making potential , where michael saves a kid from bleeding to death ; taking him to the er without knowing his name . <sssss> soon he finds out from his parents , oliver -lrb- tim robbins -rrb- and cheryl -lrb- joan cusack -rrb- that the kid is his neighbor from across the street . <sssss> `` they 've been living here for weeks , i save the boy 's life and i do n't even know his name '' , michael tells brooke -lrb- hope davis -rrb- the day after . <sssss> we admire angelo badalamenti 's score and bobby bukowski 's cinematography from the start . <sssss> director mark pellington , after having done music videos , went strong after the big screen ... succeeding , fortunately . <sssss> michel gondry made the transaction from music videos to films beautifully and successfully ; imposing his imaginative vision of the world in his movies . <sssss> on the other hand , jonathan dayton and valerie faris -lrb- directors of `` little miss sunshine '' -rrb- amazed with the simplicity of their images after leaving the music video scene . <sssss> besides these two , not many directors are really successful in penetrating their ideas into film after music videos ... pellington did it right , and in the movie everything appears new , attractive and not excessive -lrb- in the use of the resources -rrb- ; therefore not tiring for the viewer . <sssss> as pellington worked , the whole piece worked out . <sssss> never tiring , the story becomes more unpredictable by the minute and the tension never stops . <sssss> the best thing about this is that the actors end up disappearing in their characters . <sssss> it is not a long film , but there 's a point where everyone seems to have not enough energy left . <sssss> i said kevin spacey and samuel jackson were a great acting duo in `` the negotiator '' . <sssss> here , robbins and bridges are not better ; but their merit is . <sssss> without the action and the explosions of the police procedure , their work becomes something passively violent . <sssss> in conversations barely with movement , their faces have to be enough to say what 's written on the script . <sssss> and everything is so mysterious that you never know who is going to appear and what they 're going to do . <sssss> the same to be said about the female leads ; hope davis and joan cusack in two pitch-perfect jobs , cusack being a surprise for the dramatic approach . <sssss> i 'm sure shooting was not a forgettable experience for anyone involved in it , or at least it looks like it ... it 's also unforgettable for the viewer . 
ur4751428/		\tt0454921		7		i 've mentioned in many occasions that sometimes it 's good to let yourself go with a film , let yourself carry away by a story even when you know exactly what 's going to happen . <sssss> well , if you know movies , you 'll realize that you know the whole development of `` the pursuit of happiness '' when the film begins . <sssss> of course , it 's such a touching film that i do n't even have to recommend that you let yourself go , because it will come automatically . <sssss> chris gardner -lrb- will smith -rrb- is a fighter who wants the best for his family and tries hard to get it but apparently is not enough . <sssss> his wife -lrb- an overacted thandie newton -rrb- , incapable of dealing with the poverty they 're immersed in , leaves him . <sssss> chris does n't make much -lrb- in fact he 's due with the rent and there are scenes where he just has five dollars in his wallet and he has to run from a taxi driver because he ca n't pay -rrb- , wants to keep his son christopher -lrb- jaden smith -rrb- who goes to a caretaker that has the word `` happyness '' misspelled on a wall . <sssss> `` it 's with an i '' , he tells the janitor . <sssss> chris deserves a shot like the one he eventually gets . <sssss> a movie like this one needs to establish familiarities , because it 's about family , and probably gabriele muccino , whose wonderful `` di me '' deals with family , was a wise choice for the job . <sssss> he shoots the city , accompanying chris in his endeavors and takes the time to show us iconic characters that will appear from time to time throughout the film ; like a bump who thinks a product chris sells is a time machine , or a couple of hippies who steal this product from him . <sssss> muccino also makes sure that we believe the father-son relationship that defines the film , filming the kid with tenderness , as we see a shot of him walking alongside his father , but we see the kid 's face and body and only the father 's waist and feet . <sssss> but it would have been the same if muccino had n't paid attention to this ` family ' issue , because the chemistry between will smith and his son is instantaneous , natural and the main reason to watch the movie . <sssss> smith , a charismatic , versatile and popular actor , gives here what i can simply define as a winning performance ; because he wins as an actor by fulfilling a new challenge , his character wins in the story , and he wins the audience , that is amazed by scenes in which smith and his son , and no one else , generate magic . <sssss> going back to what started this review , i ask : does it matter that `` the pursuit of happiness '' is inspired by a true story ? <sssss> yes , because it instantly changes the perspective of the viewer , who will deliberate how ` true ' the events presented are . <sssss> i believe that if i 'm going to let myself go , a movie has to be fair with me ; this means it has to keep things between the limits of reality , and if things happen that are too unreal , there only has to be few of them . <sssss> `` the pursuit of happiness '' is unfair to the viewer , because it plays with him by repeating situations that at some point he has to stop believing ; or at least that 's how i felt . <sssss> is it possible that man does n't find a pen in his own house after his wife has taken everything and has to go to a store around the block to write a number down ? <sssss> yes , it 's possible , but i could n't find it believable after all the similar extreme situations that the film 's main character had been constantly going through before that exact moment . <sssss> i do n't think this is a bad or a regular movie ; i think it 's a good movie . <sssss> period . <sssss> could it have been great ? <sssss> i really do n't care , because the fact that it 's based on a true life story and smith 's performance make it more moving , and because steve conrad finds a great help in the narrated parts of his script , that make the repetitive parts of the movie seem less ... repetitive . <sssss> also , i do n't doubt the real chris gardner went through all these things ; maybe it was just too much to include in a two-hour movie . 
ur4751428/		\tt0457430		8		guillermo del toro is mexican . <sssss> i clarify this because i know it , and i assured the fact to a friend who watched `` el laberinto del fauno '' with me ; but when the movie began with a spanish accent , i doubted . <sssss> and it 's because del toro is obsessed with the spanish civil war , and we the adventures of little children in the midst of this important historical event -lrb- watch `` el espinazo del diablo '' -rrb- ; but all of this comes from his obsession with fairy tales , those that are only for children . <sssss> but look at what he does : he invents the most infantile story of all , in a film that 's everything except infantile . <sssss> this is a double-edged sword ; in fact , del toro is a double-edged sword himself . <sssss> his obsessions come from when he was little , when he imagined creatures and monsters as part of his daily reality . <sssss> he also has a photographic memory ; these are all things that can as positive as they can be negative , and it is evidenced in his way of making cinema . <sssss> the man knows a lot about cinema : he has experimented with cameras since his teenage years ; he studied make-up ... this plays against him too , mostly in `` el laberinto del fauno '' , which is one of the most technically perfect movies i 've seen in my whole life . <sssss> the impressive sound edition becomes present from the first minute ; the images are exaggeratedly beautiful ; the music is perfect , but only because it is directly connected to the plot . <sssss> all the particularities that can be found in this film 's characters come straight from del toro ; who wrote the screenplay of his fable himself . <sssss> it is an enchanting script that commences with the telling of a simple fairy tale , revealing a main fact of the story immediately . <sssss> we should remember something so fundamental , but this immersing quality of the script makes us forget . <sssss> and it 's not a complex screenplay , because it has its predictable points ; but as we get lost in a world where reality and fantasy become one , we stop caring . <sssss> reality can be so strong that sometimes we choose to escape . <sssss> the images of this film are very strong , therefore the main character , ivana , finds a magical world that keeps her constantly away from what 's happening around her . <sssss> and the point is not to ask ourselves if this ` magical world ' is real , trying to analyze every moment to put them together and see if they fit . <sssss> that 's unimportant , because in this story there 's nothing to resolve ... but there 's a lot to understand . <sssss> and i think that to really understand `` el laberinto del fauno '' , you to understand its director . <sssss> del toro 's ability to bring incredible creations -lrb- from the same ` faun ' to a monster with eyes in its hands -rrb- to us reflects the power of his imagination ; maybe his only neutral quality . <sssss> i think i 'll never completely understand del toro , but i assume that his imagination is what makes him attractive to the people who work with him ; and consequently makes them follow him anywhere . <sssss> in this aspect , `` el laberinto del fauno '' stands close to `` letters from iwo jima '' ; because just like clint eastwood in that film , del toro is an example of how crucial and predominant is the influence of the director in a cinematographic piece . <sssss> `` el laberinto ... '' is excessively long , but nobody cared ; the actors become insignificant , as if the characters had taken over them -lrb- and not the other way round as it should be -rrb- ... everything seems to be part of a bigger unit : guillermo del toro 's vision . 
ur4751428/		\tt0100263		7		i 'm giving thanks once again to the older and experienced people , for letting me know about european cinema . <sssss> on saturday i got the chance to see luc besson 's `` nikita '' , his first movie after `` le grand bleu '' . <sssss> it 's always strange the difference about the national audience and the international one . <sssss> luc besson 's films `` le grand bleu '' and `` nikita '' had lots of nominations for the césar awards and won some of them . <sssss> however , `` léon '' , usa 's favorite besson movie -lrb- it figures in the # 55 spot here on imdb -rrb- , did n't win any césar . <sssss> although incredibly , besson was n't recognized as a director , until he did his first film in the united states , `` the fifth element '' ; which got him his only best director 's césar , when he was one of the most important cinema icons in france . <sssss> i 'm glad besson always works with the same crew and team . <sssss> this could be inconvenient for some people , because they could prefer change . <sssss> for me ... this works perfectly . <sssss> today i was talking to my teacher and he described besson as a commercial filmmaker , but not in his first features . <sssss> `` nikita '' qualifies inside the category of the first features , and it has got all the characteristics . <sssss> an excellent lead : anne parillaud , i mean . <sssss> wonderful job ! <sssss> she absolutely understood the mix between sexuality and violence . <sssss> her character carries the film , and there would n't be a film without her performance . <sssss> `` what 's your name ? '' <sssss> , everyone 's asking her . <sssss> she answers : `` nikita '' . <sssss> the changes her character suffers are not usual in a film . <sssss> i said it , as it is : there 's a different way in europe with cinema . <sssss> there 's a different plot line ; another way of making things . <sssss> but saying it all over again would be useless ; you should listen to it and see it ; it 's worth it . <sssss> you just watch parillaud during the film and be witnesses of what besson is capable in terms of acting direction . <sssss> tchéky karyo is superb as bob , we know at the moment we see his face . <sssss> he arranges important meetings that unexpectedly turn into assignments . <sssss> nikita does n't understand it . <sssss> `` why do you do this to me ? '' <sssss> , she asks bob . <sssss> `` it is my way of loving '' . <sssss> about love in this movie very much can be said . <sssss> marco really loved her and she never thought about it as they were together . <sssss> she never thought much about bob either . <sssss> it was her own self hidden in the dark , for her and nobody else . <sssss> jean-hugues anglade gives marco the perfect balance . <sssss> starting from the man a woman met a simple day and invited to her home . <sssss> the naive marco . <sssss> but there 's the other marco . <sssss> violent and lonely . <sssss> again , and i imagine it has n't stopped yet , eric serra delivers his magic in his magical score . <sssss> in the first scene of `` le grand bleu '' i felt his vibe ; i got the way he was making his score . <sssss> this is the same i felt with his score in `` nikita '' , but serra managed to make me feel a different vibe . <sssss> he surprised me with another kind of style , with more adrenaline , but again , perfect for each scene . <sssss> again -lrb- yes -rrb- the cinematography makes its own world and the script is kind of raw as it is real and honest . <sssss> i said some time ago , but if the character ca n't say anything deep or complex it 's because of its nature . <sssss> nikita 's character is not the most intelligent woman in the world , although she does what she is requested to when she has to . <sssss> each character with its nature and each frame with its magic , and each line with is trueness , and luc besson ; some of the elements that make `` nikita '' a lesson about doing if not great , original and challenging film-making . <sssss> now what can you say about that ? 
ur4751428/		\tt0159365		8		i want to talk about anthony minghella , a british director , and his influence and impact on american cinema . <sssss> he is one of the most awarded directors of our time , and has done films that will be classics years from now or already are -lrb- now i know that i must see `` the english patient '' -rrb- . <sssss> but personally , it took one screening of `` cold mountain '' so i could realize all his qualities as a director . <sssss> first of all ; perfect management of the actors . <sssss> jude law is the finest example for this , if we explain that his two oscar nominations as an actor were earned for his work in two of minghella 's pieces . <sssss> once in an interview , the director said : `` when i saw jude law , i did n't feel he was right for the role . <sssss> i liked him , but he was n't what i was looking for . <sssss> but then , when i pictured dickie , i could n't imagine any face but his , so i called him '' . <sssss> and he was right , and law 's performance was great ; so was matt damon 's , and the portrayals of the whole cast . <sssss> you 'll never be disappointed in terms of cast when you watch an anthony minghella film . <sssss> this is why the man has no problem in getting the best people on the industry , if only for a few minutes appearance . <sssss> i 'm surprised this cast did n't even get nominated for best ensemble in the sag awards . <sssss> in the course of the story , we get to meet lots of wonderful characters , played sometimes for two minutes by names like jena malone , cillian murphy , giovanni ribisi ; and larger parts by names like natalie portman , kathy baker , donald sutherland , brendan gleeson and ray winstone -lrb- are you reading these names ? <sssss> -rrb- , where gleeson clearly stands out . <sssss> continuing with actors , what i most enjoyed was when law 's character meets the great phillip seymour hoffman 's character , and nicole kidman 's meets renée zellweger 's respectively . <sssss> i enjoyed it because it was amazing to see the scenes changing and watching stars of the caliber of law and kidman , each of them on their own , alongside the other two , not big stars , but actors i respect and like more watching on screen . <sssss> i compared the talents because hoffman is , well , a master in acting . <sssss> and topic apart , zellweger had made clear since `` jerry maguire '' that she urged for a deserved oscar . <sssss> although she should have won it one or two years ago , her award for her portrayal of ruby thewes is more than well earned . <sssss> a lot of power as always ; in her words , in her looks , in her way of standing ... she 's so confident about what she does and that makes her perfect . <sssss> at last ! <sssss> then i ca n't forget the main stars . <sssss> i do n't really respect nicole kidman , but i pretend to accept her because she is considered an excellent actress by a ninety percent of the people . <sssss> i can realize she changes a lot between performances . <sssss> changes everything , but forgets some very important details i will explain when i write about another of her movies ; because her performance here is good , and helps the picture a lot . <sssss> one thing i 'll say ; i keep on examining her beauty in all of her films , and i 'll tell a friend of mine , again : she 's not more beautiful than katie holmes . <sssss> i did n't mention before , but i thought it was understood : this is jude law 's best performance . <sssss> every part of his performance is understood too ; this was a challenge -lrb- a big one -rrb- for the actor . <sssss> i 'd like to compare it with adrien brody 's in `` the pianist '' . <sssss> when a character suffers the changes these both characters suffer , it needs to be expressed by the actor . <sssss> brody , i 've said before , seemed inexpressive in his film , with all the beard and hair in his ruined moment . <sssss> with the same beard and a lot of hair , law excels in showing he 's ruined , this becomes noticeable in the way he introduces himself to people , the way he talks to them ; and that 's the strength and brilliance in law 's work here . <sssss> from the way law talks , we go to the screenplay , adapted by from a novel , as he did in some of his previous works . <sssss> there are no hero intentions in this tale , no false words , no impossible love story . <sssss> everything is close to reality , which makes the piece a lot more powerful . <sssss> in one scene , when an old lady is helping inman -lrb- law -rrb- , she asks him : `` why are you going to cold mountain ? '' <sssss> , and he answers , almost crying : `` to find a woman ... and i barely even know her '' . <sssss> it 's all very convincing ; every moment . <sssss> going back to the main point ; in the sceneries , the breathtaking war scenes and everything achieved by minghella , show the committed director he is , and how he deserved and oscar nod with this feature . <sssss> he carried on a story that talks not just about love , but about several life aspects ; and a very powerful work in every sense . <sssss> with a constant melancholic tone , directed by nicole kidman 's voice , that , even in the ending , talks about good positive things , but the music and the environment of the movie makes us think negative . <sssss> i believe that 's something terrifying but somehow fantastic at the same time . 
ur4751428/		\tt0350261		8		einar gilkyson -lrb- robert redford -rrb- lives on a ranch ; all by himself and the company of mitch bradley -lrb- morgan freeman -rrb- , his oldest friend , that does n't actually makes company because an attack left him incapable of working as he used to . <sssss> however , einar controls mitch 's medicine , takes care of him , plays cards with him from time to time and even laughs a little bit of the consequences of old age . <sssss> we see their place through the camera , and we sense peace ; country music -lrb- by deborah lurie -rrb- . <sssss> `` it smells like rain today '' , einar says . <sssss> `` you have n't been right about the weather since 1972 '' , mitch responds . <sssss> a hot coffee in the morning or a glass of milk seem to be the perfect elements for two men who do n't have anything else than their cows , horses , cats and gates to worry about . <sssss> for a few minutes , we do n't wonder ; if einar has a past or unfinished business or something that could get in the way of that tranquility . <sssss> until we witness the obscure face of a woman , and the obscure scene that follows it . <sssss> she is jean -lrb- a decent but not shiny jennifer lopez -rrb- and she is being beaten by her boyfriend -lrb- damian lewis -rrb- that leaves the home quickly in anger . <sssss> `` you promised '' , a soft voice says . <sssss> then jean and her daughter griff -lrb- becca gardner , in her first and perfect portrayal -rrb- are on the road . <sssss> where are they going ? <sssss> the trail finishes in front of a fence , where einar is standing . <sssss> `` einar ! '' <sssss> , jean shouts , and a new part of these lives begins its development . <sssss> of course einar does n't want the wife of his dead son griffin there , and apparently she does n't want to be there either . <sssss> we learn a lot about all of them , slowly and unexpectedly . <sssss> mainly that einar blames jean for his son 's death . <sssss> and with sensitivity and determination , the script by mark spragg and virginia spragg -lrb- probably a married couple -rrb- goes through the usual family problems with that dignifies the content of the film . <sssss> they wrote about intense things that are never forgotten , like a son 's death that should never be surmounted by a father ; because not everyone can keep living after they loose someone they love . <sssss> they wrote about the only family you have left and the importance the things they say have in the last line of our life , and they wrote an inscription in einar 's son tomb that explains a lot of the journey . <sssss> they dealt with darker issues too , writing sinister parts for some of the characters . <sssss> if there should be villains , they would be two ; but i do n't think they are exactly villains because they keep a human form close to reality . <sssss> it 's alright to create villains , and in this movie if they are that , sheriff curtis -lrb- mathew look-alike , mostly because of `` frailty '' and talented josh lucas -rrb- will take care of them . <sssss> about the family for example , there 's morgan freeman 's mitch , who gives advices and regards the situation from the outside in some way , to the point that einar thinks he is a preacher or something of that sort . <sssss> freeman has been playing quiet characters during this decade , and here he is in a posture that resembles his award winning scrap -lrb- `` million dollar baby '' -rrb- , but somehow creating that difference that a great actor only can , delivering a fantastic show . <sssss> the chemistry with redford is impeccably managed , and redford is undeniably superb as the old drifted cowboy gilkyson , with looks and expressions full of joy and gratefulness of a comeback that are even worthy of recognition -lrb- although i know it wo n't happen -rrb- . <sssss> he has also been playing the same characters this decade ; all kinds of rare heroes with moral and consideration , like the one in `` the last castle '' , or his house man in `` the clearing '' , but none of those portrayals is nearly as good as this one . <sssss> directed by lasse hallstrom , the film reassures what the swedish director likes to do and knows ; focus in small groups of characters in determined places , like with his biggest success `` the cider house rules '' , with cuts in black like with the moving `` the shipping news '' , observing cameras in occasions like with the pleasant `` chocolat '' or extreme quietness like with the character-driven `` what 's eating gilbert grape '' . <sssss> strangely , this is a miramax release , produced by the weinsteins and probably campaigned as a major competitor for the awards season , because of all its elements -lrb- including a strong song by shania twain during the end credits -rrb- and because it looks a lot like the director 's winning film i mentioned above . <sssss> however , if the company expected that posture , it will not occur , but they will get some credit out of `` cinderella man '' . 
ur4751428/		\tt1046163		4		it was the same with this other film , `` the accidental husband '' , about a woman who ends up meeting someone that 's not mr. right , but somehow seems right . <sssss> and it 's not only the plot and the outcome that are alike , there 's something entirely wrong about the planning of both films , and the decisions they take . <sssss> it 's something that has to do with trying to defy clichés that ends up ruining the clichés they wanted to defy in the first place . <sssss> because this movie , `` my best friend 's girl '' , does not try to sidestep clichés or to make them slightly different , fresh and/or original -lrb- anne fletcher 's `` 27 dresses '' comes to mind -rrb- ; the script gives every detail a little turn - sometimes more than one - and frankly , the film becomes confusing . <sssss> jordan cahan wrote the film , his first screenplay . <sssss> there 's nothing interesting on it except a reference to norah ephron , and it 's not a reference this romantic comedy should have the right to make . <sssss> more of a comedy than romance , it tells the story of dustin -lrb- jason biggs -rrb- , who 's in love with alexis -lrb- kate hudson -rrb- and needs the help of his -lrb- the family connection intends to generate some kind of sensible , empathetic moment with a plot line concerning a fight that never works -rrb- tank -lrb- the comedian dane cook -rrb- to make her realize he 's the one for her . <sssss> `` i 'm mr. right , but not mr. right now '' , he cries . <sssss> so , this is what tank does : he makes women spend the worst night of their lives so they crawl back to their ex boyfriends . <sssss> he does it by cursing the whole time and , basically , as the movie never gets tired of reminding us - one scene involving a telephone discussion which intends to be funny would be a complete waste if kate hudson was n't so believable in her anger - , an asshole . <sssss> it 's fair to say that this is all the comic material that the film has to offer , and the truth is that the jokes never stop and they only work a few times . <sssss> howard deutch directed the film . <sssss> he 's so interested in generating laughs that he forgets about everything else that 's going on in the film . <sssss> he develops the love story with disrespect , with too many musical montages and with no concern whatsoever for the characters : therefore , the confusion . <sssss> this is no joke : in the most easy and understandable of genres , the director 's narration is incapable of achieving comprehension , and every time a romantic situation is unfolding , we have to ask ourselves a lot of questions that should n't be asked . <sssss> some romantic comedies are able to make the viewer think , and when they do it right , the viewer complies and wonders ; because the film deserves it . <sssss> in `` my best friend 's girl '' , we are not interested . <sssss> the gamble of deutch is on cook and his ability for comedy . <sssss> yes , he 's a comedian but that is n't going to make everything he says funny . <sssss> we 've seen him play this kind of role before in another awful , also sort of sex oriented romantic comedy , `` good luck chuck '' : the insensitive , selfish guy who cares about nothing and then meets a woman that changes his life . <sssss> after watching him in three films -lrb- the two mentioned and the mildly better `` dan in real life '' -rrb- , my conclusion is that he 's not an actor : he 's a comedian in movies . <sssss> he has the charm and sympathy of a leading man , but lacks the tenderness and meditation . <sssss> it 's like he never stops . <sssss> so here , neither he nor deutch stop and a couple of the jokes in the film , because of repetition , achieve big laughs . <sssss> anyway , it 's the wrong gamble . <sssss> not because the director should have chosen another actor to play the lead , but because the take on the genre is mistaken . <sssss> why ? <sssss> the director does n't even begin to understand it . <sssss> there are romantic comedies that have succeeded by embracing clichés and making , above all , an intelligent use of them . <sssss> there 's no need to put things in a different order , especially when you 're not going to do it right . <sssss> deutch does n't understand the romantic comedy because he does n't see what 's going on with it and what should be done . <sssss> that 's why he gives jason biggs a role to play himself one more time and the result is terribly boring ; that 's why he does n't take advantage of kate hudson 's enormous talent for the genre -lrb- something directors that work with her should always exploit , even though she 'll always do the job well -rrb- ; and that 's why , unintentionally and because the actor is huge , he gets from alec baldwin the best scenes of the film . <sssss> however , the fact remains : deutch did n't know what he was doing , neither technically nor dramatically . <sssss> the result is a bad movie that 's not even visually stimulating to watch , i mean aesthetically . <sssss> there 's not even one interesting idea in that aspect . 
ur4751428/		\tt0415306		7		i had great expectations with this film ; the return of the adam ferrell duo after the very good , funny and successful `` anchorman '' . <sssss> like ron burgundy , ricky bobby is a nascar driver , a unique character , one of those that only someone like ferrell can bring alive . <sssss> it 's almost like it does n't matter what the character does in the film , as long as he entertains an audience that expects a lot . <sssss> as i said , i expected a lot . <sssss> i expected to be entertained , to laugh and to discover what new range of characters mckay could bring to the table . <sssss> alongside the unstoppable ricky bobby is his best friend and teammate cal naughton jr. -lrb- the underrated john c. reilly -rrb- , his gold-digger wife carley -lrb- the beautiful leslie bibb -rrb- , a scene-stealing performance by gary cole as ricky 's father , and sascha baron cohen as a french driver called jean girard that instantly becomes ricky bobby 's rival . <sssss> everything you 've just read , from the names to the story and whatever else you may think ok , is borderline ridiculous , as it was in `` anchorman '' . <sssss> i 'm glad both ferrell and mckay -lrb- who wrote the script together -rrb- were able to honor this kind of humorous tradition , where laughter is the only disease and also the only possible medicine . <sssss> there 's no point in judging a film like `` talladega nights '' for its performances , however intelligent and accurate they are ; or for how well shot the race sequences are , as the cars try to get the number one spot ; or for how conventional may the storyline be . <sssss> this film is a statement that reassures what we could perfectly sense in mckay 's previous effort : making cinema is fun . <sssss> should i say end of the story ? <sssss> maybe , and i do n't want to sound simplistic but it 's obvious that something 's being done here and that if you want to feel it , you 'll find the movie is alright . <sssss> so when you watch `` talladega nights '' -lrb- if you decide to watch it -rrb- , take into account the whole concept and not every part . <sssss> even when there are some scenes and a few jokes that work more than others -lrb- which also happened in `` anchorman '' -rrb- , but this is the typical piece where the whole triumphs over the separation . <sssss> for me , it worked ; even though `` anchorman '' worked better . <sssss> this is the kind of parody , like `` zoolander '' and `` dodgeball '' that , whether good or bad , stays with you .

ur4751428/		\tt0397101		6		kate hudson , the most beautiful woman in the world and an excellent actress , is for me , enough reason to see a film . <sssss> her portrayal of penny lane in `` almost famous '' is one of the best performances i 've seen in my life ; she 's done drama , thriller , comedy and now mystery . <sssss> she does n't do many films but , she gets the main roles and she delivers greatly . <sssss> `` the skeleton key '' is a piece of great deliveries and a piece of great questions ; before , during and after watching it . <sssss> in the last part , great means not good but big . <sssss> this is a very original movie , and also a very complicated one . <sssss> but it is not one of those features that try to be too good ; it is a finished picture where everyone involved thought they had got it right . <sssss> i do n't think they did . <sssss> i say this because its director is not any amateur ; it 's a man with some films under his belt and with a defined style . <sssss> i liked `` k-pax '' , his last movie , but not only its moving story , but the characters in it , and the performances of the actors playing them . <sssss> softley is accurate at directing actors . <sssss> hudson plays caroline ellis , a young girl who ends up working in an old house , taking care of the husband -lrb- john hurt -rrb- of an old lady -lrb- gena rowlands -rrb- ; who after telling the story of the house to the girl , says : `` now you 're gon na leave , just like the other ones did '' . <sssss> but caroline wo n't leave , not when she 's given a skeleton key and finds some mysterious doors . <sssss> these are the three central characters , and everything unfolds around them . <sssss> hudson 's caroline is so well achieved , so palpable and real , so you can believe what she does and why she does it , in a story of this type that is generally not believable . <sssss> rowlands finds a tone of voice you need to pay close attention to ; at her 70 's , she 's still able to create different dimensions . <sssss> then john hurt , who 's fantastic ; and he does n't even speak ! <sssss> besides them , there are two other important persons , those being luke -lrb- played with the naturalness only peter sarsgaard can find -rrb- , the old family 's lawyer , and jill -lrb- a very annoying joy bryant -rrb- , caroline 's best friend . <sssss> they both seem to be the only ones able to help the girl , or even listen to her , when everything seems to be going wrong . <sssss> yes , there is a twist , and it makes you ask even more questions than the ones you were asking yourself while watching the film . <sssss> because as i said , they thought they had got it right , but writer ehren kruger seemed to have the ending finished from the beginning . <sssss> she knew it was a good one , because it is , but she must have totally forgotten to construct a correct way of leading us to it . <sssss> this causes multiple scene repetitions , long waiting times to find things we know we will find . <sssss> these movies are supposed to keep us focused the whole time ; and `` the skeleton key '' had me focused , yes , but in kate hudson . <sssss> it could have been a lot better . 
ur4751428/		\tt0297114		5		i do n't know what 's wrong with horror films . <sssss> it 's a fact that most people have something against them , and they probably should n't , but ... they just keep getting worse . <sssss> i do n't know even why i 'm putting the spoilers warning , because everybody should know what 's going to happen anyway . <sssss> some people dies and after some time and very less of thinking , the main characters -lrb- because it always seems to be about them and not about the rest -rrb- discover that it 's all because of an internet site . <sssss> of course , they both promise each other -lrb- because they seem to be in love , although no one gets the love : but the romance is obliged -rrb- they wo n't visit the site . <sssss> but you know , sooner or later , they will . <sssss> i have to admit it : this a good premise , but it 's not well developed . <sssss> it all seems to point directly to an ending . <sssss> yes , it should , but at least we should see some interesting characters . <sssss> even the man who is supposed to have all the answers does n't have them . <sssss> he acts totally uninterested . <sssss> there 's also an interesting plot point , about the main character 's past . <sssss> he 's been trying to catch `` the doctor '' , who is supposed to be the villain , but we do n't get much about him either . <sssss> we just know he is the villain because it is obvious . <sssss> always , in these movies , we get regular performances . <sssss> because , who cares if someone acts well when you 're so scared ? <sssss> in regular movies like `` the ring '' , we sometimes get good performances -lrb- naomi watts -rrb- . <sssss> this brings me to natasha mcelhone . <sssss> when i see a movie , and she 's in it , it does n't matter how important her character is ; i always remember it . <sssss> `` the truman show '' and `` city of ghosts '' come to mind right now . <sssss> i 'm saying this because she gives her character that kind of depth we are not used to see in horror films . <sssss> take my word or not , but she could be the only reason to watch this movie . <sssss> dorff is pretending , trying to be serious . <sssss> i wanted to believe him , but it was n't working . <sssss> the one character that was , though , was jeffrey combs 's sykes . <sssss> too many things could have been done with a character of this type . <sssss> it could have been more developed , but i 'm really sorry : you 'll see him four times . <sssss> three times alive , the other time dead . <sssss> this does n't affect the ending of the movie . <sssss> i mean , it would have been the same with him alive , because someone is going to save the day anyway , as always . <sssss> there 's usually one only objective in horror films : to scare people . <sssss> this did n't scare me . <sssss> i was calmed watching the film , and waiting for something . <sssss> it did n't come . 
ur4751428/		\tt0842929		8		i keep trying to explain my brother why gus van sant 's experimental work is so fascinating , why he should pay more attention to it ; maybe have a little more patience . <sssss> he could n't sit through `` elephant '' but he watched the entire `` paranoid park '' , an equally unique piece of work . <sssss> again focusing on the lives of young people , again dealing with death , again doing the editing himself , the director constructs and enviable tale of desperation among an apparent peace ; the representation of what happens when something goes out of our hands unwillingly . <sssss> the difference between `` paranoid park '' and van sant 's previous independent projects resides on the script , this time not original . <sssss> based on a novel by blake nelson , there 's a clear indication of a plot here and , even when the director keeps the visual and narrative style of the other films , there 's not too much silence and we are presented with a wider range of characters and situations . <sssss> however , and besides the story , it strikes as shocking the lack of adult figures . <sssss> alex -lrb- gabe nevins -rrb- , the film 's hero , lives with his uncle , and his voice in off tells us his parents are having problems , but we never really see the details of that . <sssss> we see alex 's mother , his uncle and even his dad , and listen to some short conversations , but they take us nowhere . <sssss> the conversations between alex and his friends and girlfriend are n't as revealing either . <sssss> the film 's focus is solely on alex this time , and that 's what my brother does n't seem to understand . <sssss> teenagers built their own precious world and hide inside it ; sometimes they talk to no one and decide very carefully with whom they share their biggest secret . <sssss> other times , they have long walks and even write about what they 're going through , anywhere : a notebook , a blog , a myspace . <sssss> this is the truth that few movies today do n't show and that van sant portrays with obsessive passion and detail . <sssss> of course the focus is also somewhere else , maybe in paranoid park , a place for skaters that 's as mysterious as the movie itself . <sssss> the same people skating the same way every day , and van sant 's shoots them in slow motion with a background of peaceful , sometimes even uncomfortable music . <sssss> fiction and reality live together in the same world as some kids appear skating and saluting the camera ; the same camera that witnesses the light and darkness , even the nothingness of their lives . 
ur4751428/		\tt0765443		8		`` eastern promises '' is not a character movie , not at all . <sssss> it 's a movie about events , but an events movie where characters matter a little more than , for example , `` the bourne identity '' and its sequels ; david cronenberg 's piece is one where you can sense more details about a bigger number of characters because the plot line has a bit more of complexity . <sssss> when a russian teenager , bathed in blood , gives birth to a little girl in a hospital and dies , anna -lrb- naomi watts in top-form -rrb- , the doctor in charge , finds and keeps the girl 's diary and decides to locate her family so the baby can have a place to grow up . <sssss> however , she gets too involved with the diary , and ends up tangled with the russian mafia in london . <sssss> it 's a london that looks beautiful , during the day and the night ; with the right choice of colors by cinematographer peter suschitzky . <sssss> in one scene , there 's a police investigation by the river , and a blue tent set up near the water causes an impression on the viewer ; it 's a light blue that strongly contrasts the dark blue of the calm water . <sssss> but back to the story ... the chief of the mob , the boss , the godfather , semyon -lrb- armin mueller-stahl -rrb- , offers anna to translate the diary in question , and everything begins when she enters his restaurant and senses something 's not right ; something in semyon 's tone of voice and look . <sssss> mueller-stahl 's performance here is superb : one of those portrayals that commonly remain unnoticed because of the understood wisdom and superiority that kind of character comes with ; it does n't look like it 's a big effort . <sssss> in the restaurant anna also meets semyon 's son , kirill -lrb- an annoying an overacted vincent cassel -rrb- and the family 's driver nikolai -lrb- viggo mortensen , the opposite of cassel -rrb- , a black - suited , mysterious man who proclaims : `` i 'm just a driver '' . <sssss> but we know there 's something more . <sssss> the roads the story takes ; the changes and indecision of the characters ; the how , why and when of every death ; and the silent love story covered in steve knight 's precise -lrb- meaning not one word that should n't be there and not a word to be added -rrb- script are almost ridiculed by how vaguely howard shore 's score captures the movie 's moods . <sssss> probably the most important scene of the film is the fight sequence in the showers where viggo mortensen basically kicks some ass and a lot of blood fills the screen -lrb- you have to watch it to believe it -rrb- . <sssss> a risky composer would have put at least something barely audible on the back , for the increase of emotion ; but shore settles for silence . <sssss> maybe i would have accepted silence from another composer in another film or a similar moment , but shore opens `` eastern promises '' with something similar to what you listen in a horror movie ; something disappointing that you expect to be better throughout the film . <sssss> it does n't make it worse , however -lrb- as jonny greenwood does n't make `` there will be blood '' worse and nick cave does n't diminishes the regularity of `` the assassination ... '' -rrb- . <sssss> of all the performances , i 'd pick mueller stahl 's , but i ca n't overlook mortensen 's composition . <sssss> you may think he displays no powerful moments , as he repeats the same thing with the same irrelevance a lot of times ; you may be expecting something like daniel day-lewis ' ` i 've abandoned my child ' scene or george clooney 's final scene in `` michael clayton '' or depp 's singing in `` sweeney todd '' . <sssss> forget it ; it would n't be as good as a performance and a betrayal to the essence of character , which is something mortensen does n't do , not even with aragorn . <sssss> the cold look , the lack of compassion , the stillness and tranquility -lrb- not even the control of the russian accent -rrb- of a character that enjoys silence , a character we know nothing about at first sight ; those are the things you should pay attention to so you realize the magnitude of mortensen 's work . <sssss> `` eastern promises '' is a film that 's so effective , so short , so expertly narrated -lrb- by its director and by the teenager character that carries out the task of another pleasant and non - traditional narration -rrb- and so quick that you may get the feeling there 's a lot missing ; that you want to see more . <sssss> if you do n't get that feeling , it means that you enjoyed the movie as what it essentially is ; if you do , appreciate the chance of trying to figure out what would have come next . <sssss> but really appreciate it , to the point that you end up enjoying it as much as the one who did n't put their minds at work ... like me . 
ur4751428/		\tt0405422		7		the ending of this film totally ruins the experience . <sssss> these guys ... they like to have fun with film-making , singing stupid songs like `` afternoon delight '' in that scene from `` anchorman '' ; but that strategy wo n't work all the time . <sssss> it does n't work at all in the ending of `` the 40 year old virgin '' , a honestly made comedic film . <sssss> so about these guys ... judd apatow has a company that produces films , films like `` anchorman '' . <sssss> i think the man is proposing a new way of real comedy , with intelligent humor . <sssss> the intelligence sometimes ironically proposes that stupidity can be the correct way of making people laugh . <sssss> apatow knows this , and he knows the people that can achieve it . <sssss> `` anchorman '' was written by director adam mckay and star will ferrell . <sssss> the cast included paul rudd , david koechner and steve carell . <sssss> apatow produced will ferrell 's recent `` kicking & screaming '' ; gave paul rudd a role ; lend david koechner a cameo ; and co-wrote with steve carell his first full-length feature , about a virgin with forty years . <sssss> carell stars ; he 's becoming quite `` the funny guy '' these days . <sssss> he produced this film , and it seems he wants to make a fool out of himself by playing the fool , but that 's exactly the reason ; because he knows he has a gift for absurd comedy and he knows he 'll make us laugh out loud with character like andy in a movie like this . <sssss> it is called self-confidence , and it is a great and basic quality in a comedian . <sssss> i do n't know any 40 year old man who 's a virgin . <sssss> i know adults that have their toys , adults that have their action figures , but no virgins . <sssss> it is an issue , a serious one , and one that can be ridiculed in excess . <sssss> apatow and his partners deal with it truthfully , from the point of view of love relationships , making the ride very sincere . <sssss> carell 's andy works with pals david -lrb- the always natural paul rudd -rrb- , jay -lrb- a funny romany malco -rrb- , cal -lrb- the very promising seth rogen -rrb- and the foreigner mooj -lrb- gerry -rrb- , who always encourages people to have sex with a goat -lrb- situations that repeat constantly so we understand the film 's language -rrb- . <sssss> besides being 40 , andy 's social situation is difficult . <sssss> when cal talks to him about the weekend , he says he went to tijuana and saw a woman having sex with a horse . <sssss> `` what did you do ? '' <sssss> , he asks andy . <sssss> `` well , i felt i really needed an egg sandwich , so i bought the egg and spent three and a half hours making the sandwich , but then i did n't feel like eating it ; and i did n't even have bread '' . <sssss> cal pretends to shoot himself while andy does n't look . <sssss> these situations the virgin experiences with all his co-workers , developing a friendship that originally comes from their objective : getting this man in bed . <sssss> eventually trish comes into his life . <sssss> she 's played convincingly by catherine keener , and has kids and andy starts dealing with them , the relationship grows but with absolutely no sex involved . <sssss> this is all very well written and is the best of the film ; andy 's talks with trish 's daughter marla -lrb- kat dennings -rrb- and ultimately a scene of a misunderstanding that delivers an unforgettable line , by an unimportant character : `` dude , teach me ! '' <sssss> it 's awesome . <sssss> the time will come for andy to reveal the truth and you 'll laugh constantly meanwhile , and in the end you 'll realize that this is a good comedy of good intentions , that judd apatow is more a planner than a director -lrb- he directed correctly and simply an idea he wanted to develop -rrb- , and that steve carell is a natural comedian ; and he 's got it going on . 
ur4751428/		\tt0403508		6		i do n't know why , and many may not approve , but `` now and then '' has always represented the ultimate girl ` life changing experience ' movie , and `` stand by me '' the same but with boys . <sssss> i talk about boys and girls , not adolescents . <sssss> maybe i missed many movies , and maybe i watch `` now and then '' today and my impression is completely different , but somehow a big change when being a kid strikes me harder than one when being a teenager ; even more if the women those kids became are there to look back on it . <sssss> in `` the sisterhood of the traveling pants '' , a ` feel good movie ' based on a popular novel , director ken kwapis has the intention of making the viewer believe that what his characters go through is sort of life changing . <sssss> four friends -lrb- there were four also in `` now and then '' -rrb- , after being their whole lives together , separate for one summer , and decide that a pair of pants that magically fits all of them , travels one week with each , carrying the experiences lived by everyone while having them . <sssss> carmen -lrb- america ferrera -rrb- is kind of our official narrator , and she introduces us to her best friends , in something like this : `` the shy and beautiful lena -lrb- alexis bledel -rrb- , the strong and overwhelming bridget -lrb- blake lively -rrb- , the unique tibby -lrb- amber tamblyn -rrb- , and me , the writer '' . <sssss> these are stereotypes , the movie admits them and tries to take them as it can . <sssss> in fact , this is what saves ` sisterhood ' from being a complete disaster . <sssss> the girls go separate ways , they do n't stick together ; therefore , each of them ` grows ' and ` changes ' on their own . <sssss> by having four different plot-lines to work , kwapis and writers delia ephron -lrb- `` you 've got mail '' -rrb- and elizabeth chandler -lrb- the masterful `` a little princess '' -rrb- are able to take a big breath . <sssss> since they do n't have the four girls together -lrb- in fact , when they do cheesiness is extreme , unreal and sometimes unbearable -rrb- , they work with their individual journeys . <sssss> this is the saving grace of the movie precisely because we get to watch different aspects of it . <sssss> if it were n't for the unquestionable excess of light , i could risk to tell you that the four stories are completely different . <sssss> they are differently shot , written , acted and the only thing that unites them is the obligatory presence of the pants . <sssss> carmen goes through a family drama , with a dad that apparently does n't care for her ; bridget lives a typical teenage forbidden romance ; lena does also , but her story is individually more complex ; and tibby continues to experience life as it is , shooting it for a documentary with the help of an unexpected friend played marvelously by jenna boyd . <sssss> some of the stories have nice moments -lrb- i liked tibby 's story the most because of its ordinary quality , free from any big or spectacular characteristic -rrb- , or nice shots -lrb- lena travels to greece -rrb- , even unexpected resolutions , but ultimately the problem of the film is that everything is automatic , with a predictable outcome . <sssss> the tagline reads `` cry . <sssss> laugh . <sssss> share the pants '' . <sssss> kwapis is so immerse in making us believe that these girls go through a big change that this affects the whole movie . <sssss> the score by cliff -lrb- he also did the score of `` now and then '' ; oh coincidence ! <sssss> -rrb- is unnecessarily moving and the performances are affected by this obligatory ` change ' factor , that the movie reaffirms in the end by relieving the element that connected any responsibility . <sssss> if anything , `` the sisterhood of the traveling pants '' is useful to reaffirm other things , whether good or bad . <sssss> that amber tamblyn is more than joan -lrb- `` joan of arcadia '' -rrb- and alexis bledel is not more than rory -lrb- `` gilmore girls '' -rrb- ; that america ferrera is truly powerful and deserves the best , and blake lively is truly overwhelming and has versatility . <sssss> there are fine male actors too , but this time it was about the girls . <sssss> oh , and they deserve that i watch the film 's second part . 
ur4751428/		\tt0426883		6		i told my dad he would n't enjoy this film ; it basically has young kids screaming at each other and cursing all the time . <sssss> that 's not a nice thing for a parent to watch , that 's not a nice thing for anyone to watch actually , but the thing is the characters are my age . <sssss> the parties they organize are not a lot different from the ones i go to ; sometimes everything stays in control but other times it gets out of our hands . <sssss> when we first see a frame in `` alpha dog '' it 's bruce willis sitting on a chair , being irreverent as only he can be , while he answers some questions about his son . <sssss> this is when we realize that something happened and we 're going to experience it ... the camera welcomes us to the world of johnny truelove , played by emile hirsch as if he does n't care about anything and as if he knows it all . <sssss> he does n't , but he bosses his friends around ; mostly elvis -lrb- shawn hatosy -rrb- who does everything truelove asks him to do . <sssss> the thing is truelove has the drugs , so truelove has the power . <sssss> everybody comes to ask him for more merchandise ; he goes to his father -lrb- the willis character -rrb- . <sssss> everybody owes him cash ; but jake mazursky owes him big time . <sssss> mazursky is portrayed perfectly by ben foster , another solid actor in a cast of young talents . <sssss> foster may not have worked as much as his peers , but he definitely made the right choices : he co-starred with hirsch in `` the mudge boy '' -lrb- the chemistry is visible here -rrb- ; he surpassed himself with his comedic lead in `` get over it '' and he amazed everyone with his turn in `` mystic river '' , among other things . <sssss> we meet jake entering his family house , where his father -lrb- david thornton -rrb- lives with a new woman , olivia -lrb- sharon stone -rrb- who gave birth to his brother , zack -lrb- anton yelchin -rrb- . <sssss> it seems that jake comes and goes as he pleases , grabs some food and asks his father for money , which is a problem for olivia , who knows the boy is on drugs ; his father also knows , but appears to be more understanding . <sssss> mazursky does not get the money , and what happens because of it consist in the development of the film ; that unexpectedly starts putting titles on screen as : ` day one ' , ' a.m. ' . <sssss> from the beginning , nick cassavetes imposes his style to the picture . <sssss> taking a complete turn from `` the notebook '' , the writer/director chooses a camera with a small amount of light -lrb- the man robert fraisse -rrb- , that does n't let us see important things at times . <sssss> uncertain and personal , he divides the screen in two at the most surprising moments . <sssss> his screenplay , inspired by true events , must have also had something of his own life . <sssss> i 'm not saying he was on drugs , but the way the characters talk is annoying , nevertheless true and accurate . <sssss> but something fails in the story ; maybe it 's too long and it does n't move on . <sssss> it seems like an eternity and it looses focus . <sssss> anyway , cassavetes ' best achievement with `` alpha dog '' is unquestionably the direction of actors . <sssss> an ensemble with a-list stars and independent greats ; a big cast to handle ... a lot of young actors . <sssss> `` the o.c 's '' olivia wilde , chris marquette -lrb- from `` the girl next door '' -rrb- , amanda seyfried -lrb- from `` mean girls '' -rrb- , an unrecognizable harry dean stanton , the inconstant but good dominique swain , and justin timberlake . <sssss> as truelove 's right hand frankie , timberlake gets the best performance of the cast . <sssss> forget n'sync , forget his music , just watching constructing his character and making it a human being . <sssss> it 's hard to explain but the singer is really the only actor who gets some true emotion out of his lines . 
ur4751428/		\tt0450278		5		i 've been looking for an excuse so i did n't have to write about this film , but i could n't find it yet . <sssss> so if this does n't say much if because there is not much to say about `` hostel '' , eli roth 's last cinematographic project . <sssss> frankly , the movie is awful . <sssss> you know when they say you should get a lot with little ? <sssss> eli roth got it , but he got a lot of the wrong elements and little of the good ones . <sssss> part of this horror `` renaissance '' , `` hostel '' presents a small amount of characters in a maximum of two important environments . <sssss> it 's a matter of short time before the characters arrive to this so called hostel and they live the most terrifying experiences of their lives . <sssss> unlike neil marshall and his `` the descent '' , characters here are not developed or even detailed ; roth does n't seem to need that for the development of the picture . <sssss> josh and paxton are two friends who just want some good pot and some good sex with some beautiful girls , nothing else , and they are portrayed by derek richardson and jay hernandez with more conviction than the bad movie deserves -lrb- mostly by hernandez -rrb- . <sssss> so we also find the enigmatic and weird characters that are not just common people in a film like this one . <sssss> we find the receptionist in the hotel who does n't even speak or answer questions . <sssss> then what we find is just what has to happen so we can at least see something of content in the picture . <sssss> what happens , i could say , is not plenty but it 's enough . <sssss> you get to a point , sometimes when you 're watching a movie , where you do n't know how you got to watch it until that point ; because you know that you 're not watching anything . <sssss> `` hostel '' may be appealing for the horror fans because it respects horror and gives horror what it needs . <sssss> and i understand that . <sssss> the part i could n't understand has to do with the plot , and i do n't know if the fans care about that . <sssss> let 's just say that eli roth has an amazing eye for the genre but a regular eye for storytelling . <sssss> his camera moves expertly and explores without limits , but his scripts does n't make a move . <sssss> when the main explanation arrives to our eyes and ears , it 's so pointless that it becomes funny . <sssss> we accept it as it comes , but the explanation is followed by a last scene that is actually terrific and a minimum reason to watch the piece . <sssss> however , the power of this scene and the impression it generates , comes too late to compensate the other stuff . <sssss> what else can i say ? <sssss> well , just do n't bother . 
ur4751428/		\tt0319262		6		we just get more and more disaster movies each year . <sssss> actually we do n't give a damn about less than the half of them , but from time to time , a super production costing millions and we got to see it . <sssss> last year , `` the day after tomorrow '' was that super production . <sssss> these movies do n't get as wild as this one . <sssss> german director roland emmerich makes a big effort to improve his style each time he makes a new movie . <sssss> the movies he directs are not always potentially prepared to be `` art '' , but the man takes the job too seriously , and you can tell the movies are `` his '' ; even when he does n't write them . <sssss> he commits completely and achieves visual levels beyond imagination . <sssss> he takes care of little details , like not showing some computer animated wolves closely , so they look as real as possible . <sssss> regretfully , i have n't seen any good movie under his direction . <sssss> i never finished watching `` the patriot '' , though ; and i was loving it . <sssss> and yes , emmerich 's specialty is `` disaster '' films . <sssss> there 's a big dilemma with disaster films , because they try to mix action and , well , disaster , with emotion . <sssss> i has worked for me with `` daylight '' , a movie that was for me a before and after disaster films -lrb- as one of sylvester stallone best performances -rrb- . <sssss> why ? <sssss> simply because its only cliché was the `` disaster '' ; and that 's for me the best compliment you can give a movie of this type . <sssss> other recent `` disaster '' film was `` deep impact '' ; and i admit i tended to laugh in the most dramatic moments of the film ; because i could n't feel for the one-dimensional character and i preferred them to die than to listen to them saying melodramatic shits in their final moments . <sssss> now the thing is ; roland emmerich may know a lot about disaster , but knows nothing about drama . <sssss> as he has probably done before , he checks the book of clichés so he can provide some substance in what he does worse . <sssss> what we get from him in this occasion is one weak father-son relationship , with separated marriages , a father that works constantly and does n't have time for his son . <sssss> yet , when he father arrives late or forgets things , the boy forgives him ... the boy loves him , and loves a girl , and has a friend ... and the three of them go to new york for a contest , but jack is working with professor rapson and discovers the new ice age is coming -lrb- and you know how it goes from that -rrb- ... in another ensemble cast with the stars of the moment , the father is called jack hall , and is played by dennis quaid ; who has been climbing to the top since `` the rookie '' . <sssss> i 've heard he has been doing the same for a long time -lrb- although i was shocked by his performance in `` far from heaven '' -rrb- , but even in his clichéd character with hero moments , he passes the acting test . <sssss> the mother 's name is lucy , and sela ward gives her agility and emotion . <sssss> professor rapson is in ian holm 's skin , and holm is bored ; looking for money maybe . <sssss> the son is called sam hall , in the skin of jake gyllenhaal , coming as the best element of the film ; with a lot of personality and charm to a role that as easy as the one he had . <sssss> it 's another big step in his short career . <sssss> the girl , laura , it 's played by emmy rossum . <sssss> she looks gorgeous and very natural . <sssss> they are the ones that will stay with a bunch of other , few people -lrb- the `` survivors '' -rrb- , as the victims with no way out , and sam 's responsibility according to script is not more than saving them . <sssss> do the `` survivors '' survive ? <sssss> what do you think ? <sssss> to accentuate things more , emmerich supports the dramatic environment with pathetic but sweet moving music , set decorations , designs and cinematography ... once said that , the movie looks beautiful , and the special effects are flawless ; but maybe that 's the only thing emmerich can do without problems . <sssss> as we will see many years from now , the movie had to be set in new york ... they just love to destroy those things ... the statue of liberty , the empire state ... if they are going to freeze a city , new york will be the first choice . <sssss> when the film ended and the credits were rolling , i wondered : if roland emmerich knows so much about disaster and nothing about drama ... why does n't he just destroys everything without leaving any trace of life ? <sssss> then the screen was black . 
ur4751428/		\tt0467406		9		to begin with , i want to put things on the table with the comparisons . <sssss> because this decade , we 've experienced cases like `` juno '' ; films that grow with time and suddenly are best picture contenders for the academy awards . <sssss> well , `` juno '' is better than `` little miss sunshine '' and much better than `` sideways '' ; it surpasses the latter one on comedic and dramatic levels and , although it does n't have ` sunshine 's ' dramatic power , it features a more prominent collection of scenes and it has a script that 's impossible to beat . <sssss> i do n't want to underestimate director jason reitman 's delicate and inspiring job , but you ca n't deny there 's something about diablo cody 's first work that lies beyond explanation . <sssss> if this writing seems more formal than usual , it 's because cody wrote the main character 's lines with a noticeable level of superiority that is at the same time contradictory . <sssss> because juno -lrb- ellen page -rrb- appears to know it all with the level of vocabulary i 'm talking about , however when she gets pregnant she does n't know what to do . <sssss> and that 's not all . <sssss> sixteen-year-old girls call their friends ` dude ' - or at least juno is one of she has her fair share of code words that even the wisest teenager in the room may have trouble understanding ; not to mention the fact that she listens to really heavy rock music and she dresses almost like guy . <sssss> yes , she 's a freak , but not with the glasses and the weird dresses she describes in one of the film 's many funny scenes -lrb- cody 's wonderful script includes a non-traditional form of narration by juno that works perfectly -rrb- ; she 's very pretty . <sssss> when she discusses the reason of her pregnancy with her best friend leah -lrb- olivia thirlby -rrb- , she mentions who the father is and makes obvious that she feels something for him . <sssss> if you know comedy and romance , you will expect a certain number of exact , by heart phrases that the best friend would use in that moment . <sssss> she uses none of them , and it 's beautiful . <sssss> so when we ` meet ' the father in another great scene , we fully understand that juno is ` special ' . <sssss> special as a couple ; vanessa and mark loring -lrb- jennifer garner and jason bateman in two fantastically unexpected portrayals -rrb- think she is , when they meet her because she wants to ` give ' them her baby . <sssss> that scene , how juno constantly refers to the baby as `` the thing '' ; how she ends up playing the guitar with mark ; the rest of the scenes she shares with him in which , among other things , she tells him he 's a big ` sellout ' ; and my favorite moment of the film are pieces of a well-rounded , multidimensional character we are not used to see in a comedy . <sssss> and ellen page ? <sssss> she hands in a masterclass ; a bliss of understanding of character and of sheer honesty , a better performance than julie christie 's in `` away from her '' . <sssss> she has that light ; the light of a true talent ; the light i saw when i first watched winona ryder in `` reality bites '' and made me want to watch all of her films -lrb- i have almost completed the task -rrb- . <sssss> and of course page also has that look ; the look that says `` this is no game '' . <sssss> when it comes to performance , this movie is hers and nobody else 's . <sssss> and i have n't even mentioned the scene where she gives his father and stepmother -lrb- j.k. simmons and allison janney -rrb- , and how they react and the advices they give here in that moment and in so many others ; or the multiple film references in cody 's script and the fact that it has clearly remained untouched . <sssss> i really want to detail many scenes , but instead i 'll just tell you which one 's my favorite -lrb- there 's plenty to choose -rrb- , so you can pay attention : the moment near the end where one character 's running and juno walks to him ... that moment , that scene . <sssss> it has been said , but the unchangeable truth is reitman and cody do something many movies try unsuccessfully these days : aim directly at the heart ... they do n't miss . <sssss> i hope i said all i had to say . 
ur4751428/		\tt0426931		7		i ca n't get enough of saying that there are formulaic movies that just work . <sssss> today i was watching a film with some friends about a girl who does ice skating and plays ice hockey at the same time . <sssss> she has to choose between both , but the movie is arranged so that she can do both ... how great ! <sssss> of course ; extraordinary events take place so this can happen , but as they say : `` the end justifies the mediums '' . <sssss> kirsten sheridan 's `` august rush '' is , surprisingly , not about sport . <sssss> there 's no team or single player who wants to win a championship ; there 's just a boy who wants to find his parents and believes music can help him , guide him . <sssss> `` all you have to do is listen '' , the little boy played joyfully by freddie highmore whispers . <sssss> he 's so charming that a child protecting services worker -lrb- terrence howard -rrb- gives his number to him . <sssss> soon , the boy finds himself in new york : `` how did you get here ? '' <sssss> , a truck driver who leaves him on the street asks him . <sssss> `` i followed the music '' . <sssss> there 's another story being told apart from the boy 's , and it 's the one of his parents -lrb- jonathan rhys-meyers and a lovable keri rusell -rrb- . <sssss> it tells how they met in new york and it 's all really nice and perfect at night and they spend together the most beautiful night of their lives , with more music and contemplation than words . <sssss> this is during the whole film . <sssss> the contemplation is not part of the filming style and it 's not there to serve the story ; it 's that the script is too short and the filmmakers waste time with musical numbers and visual passages . <sssss> from time to time , like during some of the magical numbers , `` august rush '' makes us believe that music can connect people in the way the movie wants it to . <sssss> it would be easier to believe if the boy 's parents were n't so related to music -lrb- the father is a rock musician and the mother is a cellist -rrb- and if the film 's circumstances were n't so predictable . <sssss> but then , if everything was different , we would n't be charmed by the movie and it would n't be the same . <sssss> in these types of things , it has to be all or nothing , so it seems fair to say that sheridan made all the right decisions . <sssss> for example , there are like two moments where the film could skip a predictable moment -lrb- some formulaic pieces do -rrb- ; but it does n't . <sssss> `` august rush '' gladly admits its ` clichés ' , so we also have an evil character played by robin williams as a man with good intentions but who ultimately cares about himself and no one else . <sssss> on the other hand , you find terrence howard 's comprehensive face , or that one of a priest in a church where the boy spends one night . <sssss> when he wakes up he learns two things in the piano from a little girl and when the girl comes back from school she tells the priest : `` remember when you said that mozart was a prodigy ? <sssss> well , i have one and he 's living under my bed '' . <sssss> that scene brought a smile to my face . <sssss> because this is the best these films can do ; they can make us escape from reality for a while and hope for a better world . <sssss> i 'm not making any statements or trying to say the world is a bad place , but the world is nothing like `` august rush '' and it will never be ... that 's for sure . <sssss> i want to add that i have n't explained most of the plot and i 've skipped many important details you 'll find in any review and even a simple plot description of the film , but it 's on purpose : i honestly think you can enjoy this one . <sssss> you should give it a try . 
ur4751428/		\tt0907657		8		`` at first they are flirting , and by the end they 're f *** ing like animals '' , says writer/director john carney of the scene in `` once '' where the guy -lrb- glen hansard -rrb- and the girl -lrb- marketa irglova -rrb- sing `` falling slowly '' for the first time . <sssss> it 's a beautiful song , understated like the whole movie ; and it 's not only a beautiful scene , but also one of the most truly moving cinematographic scenes i 've ever seen . <sssss> i know the feeling ; i 've sung with people i did n't know whether they could do it well and been amazed beyond words ; i 've fallen in love playing music . <sssss> it 's not the romantic relationship kind of love ; it 's something from a completely different universe . <sssss> anyone who says `` once '' is a bad film has to be either a music hater or ... a music hater . <sssss> once in a lifetime you 'll watch a movie like `` once '' , because from now if you experience something similar it 's going to come from here . <sssss> carney and his team , the emotional photography of the digital camera and the austere use of light ; hansard , his earnest voice and uncompromising songs ; irglova , her unique smile and the mystique that surround her ; they might have created a completely new film genre i would n't dare to give a name to . <sssss> i regret some unnecessary moments where carney takes the viewer for granted by showing characters smiling when they listen to the music this guy and this girl play . <sssss> we do n't need to see the typical shot of the ` approving face ' ; we like it and we approve it and that should be enough . <sssss> you want to laugh ? <sssss> you will , watching five musicians getting into a studio and not knowing what to do . <sssss> you want to rejoice ? <sssss> you can close you eyes and listen to the music that , even when it shares some similarities with my beloved damien rice , comes from a parallel world that -lrb- i 'm starting to think -rrb- only exists in ireland . <sssss> you might cry too , but that 's depending on how sensitive you are . <sssss> one last thing : this is not a romantic comedy and it does n't even come close to one . <sssss> but if it were , i would hand an immense compliment to the story because it is , yes , very romantic and unlike anything you 've seen . <sssss> free of clichés , formulas and -lrb- predictable or not -rrb- convenient endings . <sssss> do n't lie to yourselves , because you know those are the main characteristics of a rom-com and you would n't like them if they were any different . <sssss> `` i do n't know you but i want you even more for that '' -- from `` falling slowly '' 
ur4751428/		\tt0356150		5		ultimately , what this film did best was to make me realize that `` the girl next door '' is a good comedy . <sssss> i never talked about `` the girl next door '' , but always considered it disgusting and uncommitted ; i was wrong . <sssss> i adored the movie because i was laughing as i hardly laugh , and some people may question the pornographic orientation of the film , but they ca n't deny it is original . <sssss> `` euro trip '' is funny , in extreme moments , but the way it is done reminds a lot to other films than `` the girl next door '' . <sssss> a film like `` euro trip '' is in the vein of the one year earlier `` american wedding '' , one of the last good comedies . <sssss> since its first installment , `` american pie '' proposed music of the most known groups at the time , which was horrible and then got repeated in all of the sequels . <sssss> then lots of those movies came and it was becoming unbearable ... one year had to go by , and they had to do this movie , with all the songs , the teenage life -lrb- these are grads -rrb- , the friends ' reunions , a trip throughout europe and the characters that they 'll meet and lots of other elements i 'll proceed to explain in detail , like , for example , the joke that keeps on going during the whole film . <sssss> when lead character scotty -lrb- newcomer scott mechlowicz -rrb- looses his girlfriend fiona -lrb- `` smallville 's '' kristin kreuk -rrb- , he is humiliated in front of the whole senior year at the moment lustra 's lead singer donny -lrb- a refreshing cameo appearance by matt damon -rrb- presents their song : `` this is a song about the craziest , nastiest sex puppet i know ... fiona '' . <sssss> the song talks about what he and the girl do together every day and the chorus goes by : `` scotty does n't know , scotty does n't know ... '' . <sssss> this will be repeated each time he meets an individual . <sssss> with his heart broken , he reads one of the many mails his german friend mieke -lrb- scott calls him mike -rrb- sends him constantly , and notices that he desires to arrange a meeting with him ; he wants to come to the states to visit him . <sssss> that 's when he recalls how his best friend cooper -lrb- jacob pitts -rrb- has warned him about that , assuring the german friend was gay . <sssss> scott insults the guy with his response , just to find out the next day that the `` he '' was a `` she '' and to decide to make a trip to germany to find her . <sssss> ironically they 'll never get to germany , but because of fate they 'll get together with the twins jenny -lrb- michelle trachtenberg -rrb- and jamie -lrb- travis wester -rrb- and fulfill a euro trip . <sssss> during this time in europe , it is up to writers alec berg , david mandel -lrb- of course it 's not mamet -rrb- and jeff schaffer to make us laugh or not . <sssss> there are some particular scenes that are very original and therefore funny , and there some typical gross ` impossible not to laugh ' moments . <sssss> their main love story is not very believable , but serves as an excuse , but the other things involving relationships are well thought . <sssss> however , laughs come most of the times by the hand of the cast . <sssss> jacob pitts is a revelation . <sssss> he is gifted in his timing , unmistakable in his looks , and has that david spade face all over . <sssss> he steals the piece creating the funniest moments . <sssss> the other surprise is travis wester as the nerdy and predictable jamie . <sssss> maybe he was chosen for the role because he is like that in real life , but as i do n't know that for sure , i can say he 's got the moves . <sssss> and just not to forget , michelle trachtenberg got me in `` harriet the spy '' and she 's managed her career well . <sssss> nice comedic turn here . <sssss> the men who wrote the feature also directed it . <sssss> i wanted to mention that because the credit has to be given . <sssss> their directing work seems to be more a work of fun than a commitment with film-making ; and i do n't know less i care if they really went to each of europe 's countries . <sssss> the truth is the movie is not complexly shot and if they actually traveled around europe that would be enough to justify their shooting motives . <sssss> finalizing , `` eurotrip '' will not mark a tendency in comedies , neither will be remembered as an artistic piece or something similar , but i can guarantee it will open gates for some talented young actors and it wo n't get you bored . 
ur4751428/		\tt0316732		4		i have n't seen the original or read the original screenplay , so i ca n't make any comparisons . <sssss> but i have seen queen latifah and jimmy fallon in this really bad film . <sssss> i would just like to put thinks clear , because truly , sometimes a movie tries to hard to accomplish its objective but it ultimately fails . <sssss> honestly , this film stole some laughs from me , but not many , i mean : it was really stupid and nonsense most of the time . <sssss> i could n't think of anyone believing that if a person is funny doing one thing , this makes that person funny in doing anything . <sssss> yes , as many could say , jimmy fallon spreads talent all around when he steps on the `` snl '' set . <sssss> but when he steps on a movie set , i have to tell him : `` that 's different buddy , you 're not doing the same thing you do always '' what a mistake they made in telling this guy to act as he always does . <sssss> movies are another thing , and for a television actor , a very important chance . <sssss> you 're ruining it , jimmy ! <sssss> it was awful to hear this guy talking and see him making faces . <sssss> he had the stupid lines -lrb- `` my precious '' -rrb- and the embarrassing moments . <sssss> i mean , the movie was embarrassing in these moments , but he made it more embarrassing . <sssss> good luck with your next project , jim , although i 'm not expecting one . <sssss> the rest of the cast was pretty solid , for what they needed to do . <sssss> queen latifah continues to grow -lrb- and i 'm really sorry if you do n't agree -rrb- as a charming leading lady -lrb- in this case playing the taxi driver belle -rrb- becoming the only worthy thing to watch in the movies she 's in . <sssss> i mean , last year i went to see `` bringing down the house '' ; i fell asleep ! <sssss> she woke me up , or a friend of mine , i think . <sssss> so i should just recognize latifah 's talent and hope she continues to grow . <sssss> the experienced ann-margret has the biggest , if not the only laughs in the movie , drinking without stopping for a second , and living next to his son washburn -lrb- jimmy fallon -rrb- . <sssss> this made me thought if fallon lives with his mother too . <sssss> henry simmons , still a newcomer , gave the best of his character , which was n't much . <sssss> actually , nothing could be much at all , because the storyline was so repetitive and the script was so lame . <sssss> they just could n't get tired of chasing scenes , could they ? <sssss> the film is not a shame when it comes to direction ; but i just ca n't understand why tim story , after doing a respectable comedy like `` barbershop '' , got into this . <sssss> there was a lot of movement in the camera , not that bad . <sssss> the statue of liberty shot and times square were n't forgotten , of course . <sssss> if i do n't say much about the story , it 's not because i want you to find out , but because it would be useless -lrb- you 'll probably get what i mean , later -rrb- . <sssss> but then after all , we end up wanting a little bit more from this piece that does n't provide us as it should . <sssss> a one paragraph should be written , praising the team for putting jennifer esposito and gisele bundchen in the same movie . <sssss> these two fine women are reason enough to watch this film . <sssss> they were intelligent enough to know the movie was n't working ; but they knew the girls would . <sssss> this is also a business . 
ur4751428/		\tt0101921		8		there 's no other way to put it ; there are films that just make you feel good . <sssss> these films are reasonably called ` feel good ' movies ; you may watch them and have a good time and a week later forget everything about them : `` in good company '' comes to mind . <sssss> other films also make you feel good but also leave an impression , because of the memorable characters they contain and you want to keep close to your heart : `` barbershop '' is the perfect example . <sssss> but there are also ` feel good ' movies that break their own rule , scratch the surface looking for something more and they find it : leaving a message . <sssss> jon avnet 's `` fried green tomatoes '' tells a straight story , the one david lynch waited so many years to tell . <sssss> based on a book by fannie flagg , the movie introduces us to evelyn couch -lrb- a sensational kathy bates -rrb- , a woman who 's having a mid-life crisis and who 's visiting his husband ed 's -lrb- gailard sartain -rrb- aunt at a nursing home . <sssss> but this aunt does n't like her , throws things at her and she has to sit outside and wait . <sssss> and there comes an lady who seems so full of life that we envy her . <sssss> this is ninny threadgoode , played by jessica tandy as the most caring , comprehensive , friendly , lovable woman you could meet . <sssss> it 's from her that we learn the main story , in a movie that contains many stories . <sssss> because everyone has a story , and sometimes two people share the same story , and nobody can imagine them in different contexts , like idgie -lrb- mary stuart masterson -rrb- and ruth -lrb- mary-louise parker -rrb- . <sssss> in two fantastic performances that depend on each other , masterson plays idgie as a rebellious girl who slowly understands what true love and being mature means ; while parker 's work represents exactly the opposite . <sssss> at first , we see ruth as a quiet lady -lrb- always a lady -rrb- who follows the bible 's rules by heart and , over the years , she seems to let go , and while never forgetting her values , starts to live a little more freely and holding on to the ones who love her the most . <sssss> these are n't stereotypes , but basic descriptions , sketches , of two characters that will helplessly grow on you as they grow on each other with time ; and of their story , which i want to let you discover . <sssss> making use of a classic resource as narration , avnet lets tandy 's character take us back in time to ruth and idgie 's world . <sssss> it 's a beautiful world , a beautiful little town and a beautiful café where these women serve fried green tomatoes that avnet also displays and shoots classically . <sssss> the music , by thomas newman , is also classic , non - intrusive in a sense . <sssss> so there 's no risk in what we see on screen , and no risk in the story either ; the tale is predictable and the ` intrigue ' plot-line it contains could have been resolved differently . <sssss> but avnet risks everything in one aspect , and that 's where his movie succeeds . <sssss> he utterly trusts his main actors -lrb- his four main actresses , more accurately -rrb- in the creation of the characters i told you about ; and they respond , making every word sound true . <sssss> that 's why we do n't question that characters tell the same story three times and nothing feels clichéd , that 's why the connection that evelyn has with two people she never met is intensely real . <sssss> you may wonder , after all this , what the message i 'm talking about is . <sssss> it 's quite simple actually : that friendship conquers all , friendship beats all odds ; the friends we meet along the way make us who we are . <sssss> there are so many films that struggle so hard to get that simple message through and it never happens . <sssss> `` fried green tomatoes '' achieves it and still kindly leaves some things unsaid for us to meditate ; and it makes us feel good , and it makes us want to eat these fried green tomatoes , whatever they are . 
ur4751428/		\tt0387131		7		i remember `` cidade de deus '' , fernando meirelles ' film that got him a lot of recognition and made him the important director he is today . <sssss> i remember the film because it was visually amazing , but also because it had a story to tell about reality and because meirelles was never worried about how hard reality could get . <sssss> my father said : `` that movie is so violent '' , and i agreed . <sssss> now after a geniality of that kind , meirelles needed to come with something at least good if he wanted to keep it going . <sssss> `` the constant gardener '' came to him as something fresh and simple , in the waiting of an experienced hand to twist it and make it complicated . <sssss> so meirelles did the dirty work , and did it perfectly . <sssss> i do n't know if this film would have been as real and as violent in the hands of another director . <sssss> once more , the visuals and the sceneries are a main character ; because this time meirelles shot in africa , and he took advantage of the view and exploited it brilliantly so we could enjoy it . <sssss> the film has the addition of the music as another of the highlights in the film . <sssss> alberto iglesias understood the environment of the locations and the mystique of the characters , providing the images a disturbing score . <sssss> the story is also disturbing . <sssss> based on the novel by john le carré , jeffrey caine wrote a screenplay that asks a lot of questions and becomes interesting for the viewer . <sssss> when i wrote about `` levity '' the other day , i mentioned ` gardener ' ... caine 's screenplay is well written , and it will make you wonder ; but it 's very simple in the end , not like solomon 's philosophic story about redemption . <sssss> `` the constant gardener '' is a slow film , and it could have been very boring if meirelles had n't thought of the right cast members . <sssss> the two main players in the film are actors i love but never put in front of other i truly admire or consider my favorites . <sssss> ralph fiennes is an exceptional actor : i first saw him in `` quiz show '' but his credits include wonderful performances in dramas like `` sunshine '' , thrillers like `` red dragon '' and silly comedies like `` maid in manhattan '' . <sssss> that he could n't be a contender for his role in this film is a shame . <sssss> i ask : is rachel weisz the high point of meirelles ' film ? <sssss> i answer : i love her , won the sag award , the golden globe and the oscar for best supporting actress ; but her performance is n't really something to be astounded about . <sssss> even so , she achieves the most solid portrayal of the movie , as fiennes ' ambitious wife . <sssss> the ever supporting actor pete postlethwaite scores another surprising performance in his 50 's . <sssss> he 's been forgotten by people ... but he 's fantastic . <sssss> danny huston and bill nighy also appear in supporting roles and do it just fine . <sssss> but is meirelles as a director the person we admire the most in the project ... because we know he did it all ; and that 's awesome . 
ur4751428/		\tt0491747		7		sarah polley -lrb- `` the i inside '' , `` the life before this '' , `` my life without me '' and others -rrb- , a fantastic independent actress , has directed a movie now ; which is , of course , very independent . <sssss> it is called `` away from her '' and , after a blinding white gives way to some credits , the voice of a man tells a beautiful short anecdote ; about how his wife proposed to him . <sssss> this is grant -lrb- gordon pinsent -rrb- , and there 's tenderness in his voice that turns to be very unusual for a guy his age . <sssss> it 's just that he has lived his life and has learned to be patient , because his wife fiona -lrb- julie christie -rrb- has been loosing her memory for some time now ; and he 's standing right by her side . <sssss> alzheimer is a difficult issue to deal with in film ... there 's a brilliant argentine film , `` el hijo de la novia -lrb- `` the son of the bride '' -rrb- , and it managed to make the whole country cry and laugh at the same time as it dealt with such a strong issue . <sssss> polley has achieved the same thing with her first directing attempt , even when it 's not at all brilliant . <sssss> the canadian actress has worked a lot with director isabel coixet , and it is clear in `` away from her '' that she 's taken a lot from the spanish filmmaker . <sssss> however , i remember coixet 's direction with a lot of quiet observations , which most of the time did n't last too long . <sssss> polley 's observation is the dominant aspect of her film ; as the camera shows incredible shots and follows the characters or simply the environment , while jonathan goldsmith 's catchy score plays in the background . <sssss> there 's so much to see in `` away from her '' because it is polley 's intention for us to do so . <sssss> hers is the slowest movie i 've seen so far this year , but that does n't make it less affectionate . <sssss> maybe it is slow because that 's the way old people go through the last phase of their lives ... very slowly . <sssss> grant is a caring man who loves his wife so much that even when he persuades her to go into a clinic , he backs down at the last minutes and tells her : `` do n't go ... do n't go like this '' . <sssss> fiona , on the other hand , is nothing more than the same ; only that she finds difficult to remember or to find the love she feels , because of her condition . <sssss> on the same day she to the clinic , she and grant go to her new bedroom . <sssss> `` you know what i would like ? <sssss> i would like to make love and then i would like you to go '' . <sssss> this is how she expresses her feelings . <sssss> and grant is a very wise man , we realize from his conversations with other characters , but is unable to act wisely about what 's happening because he 's blinded by love ; and we are fools when we are in love . <sssss> the age does n't matter . <sssss> and they are the only ones who really matter in the film . <sssss> there are some great supporting characters , superbly performed by the supporting actors , but it 's really about gordon pinsent 's portrayal of unconditional kindness and romance ; and julie christie 's flame that never seems to go away , even when her character seems hopeless . <sssss> what a way to carry a film . <sssss> if what she used for directing was n't so original , polley makes it up with a moving script , away from dullness in each of its words . <sssss> it 's not long at all , considering that it is based on alice munro 's short story -lrb- `` the illusionist '' was based on a short story and ran a bit longer than it should have -rrb- ; and it contains unexpected moments of comedy that relief the viewer from a constant air of depression and sadness . <sssss> apparently polley knows old aged people , because the jokes they make and the things they say , sound as things both of my grandmothers would say . <sssss> do n't stay away from `` away from her '' and wait for polley 's next movie ; i 'm sure it will have that ` spark of life ' so characteristic of fiona , and hopefully more personality . 
ur4751428/		\tt0301976		5		you know when a movie is many things , a lot of things ; everything but good ? <sssss> well , it just happened to me with `` the united states of leland '' . <sssss> it was at the beginning , with an interesting introduction by a character , when i was ready to get in . <sssss> i watched quietly a lot of people falling apart , without knowing the exact reason . <sssss> but as the movie says : `` maybe there 's no reason , maybe there 's no why '' . <sssss> maybe there 's nothing . <sssss> matthew ryan hoge , the film 's director , reminds me to james d. stern , when doing his first film `` it 's the rage '' . <sssss> in that movie you could see plenty of great actors all around , and as in this one , known people that only says one phrase . <sssss> in the latter film , i could n't figure out what were those stars doing there , and i found myself in the same situation with this film -lrb- well , kevin spacey produced it -rrb- . <sssss> kevin spacey , don cheadle , jena malone , lena olin , ryan gosling ... the list goes on . <sssss> one thing here is that stern was only a director ; hoge is also a writer and his script must have attracted his co-workers . <sssss> however , the writing suffers from typical first screenplays characteristics : pretentious , long and , in this case , we can add insecure . <sssss> with that beautiful music it has , the movie seems to arrive at its climax more than one time , where hoge creates another `` junk '' , as he calls the other word in his screenplay . <sssss> this junk wanders between the guilt , mind and decisions in leland 's -lrb- ryan gosling -rrb- young life . <sssss> it becomes tedious and repetitive after times and if you 're reasonable enough , you figure out the movie is going nowhere , because you only get some of it at forty minutes of time . <sssss> then it shows everyone involved in leland 's circle : girl becky -lrb- jena malone -rrb- , father albert -lrb- kevin spacey -rrb- , mother marybeth -lrb- lena olin -rrb- , the pollard family -lrb- michelle williams , martin donovan , ann magnuson -rrb- with allen -lrb- kevin kline -rrb- and bastard pearl madison -lrb- don cheadle -rrb- ; and throws some though-provoking lines here and there with his constantly moving camera and later tries to go back to the beginning before you realize you 've completely lost it because the screenplay did n't even have a sure starting point . <sssss> do n't be fool by its fresh environment , spacey produced the movie and he did bad in acting also , because he added nothing to nothingness . <sssss> he 's great in his character , as he always is when acting , but in the wrong place . <sssss> jena malone is one of the best of her generation , and even when she still gets the emotional impact with her performance , i sense she 's been ready for something bigger ; a type of character change , another risk level , like the ones ryan gosling likes to take . <sssss> i 've seen him three times and his performances were three totally different rides . <sssss> his risk takes him to extremes only a few reach . <sssss> that 's how hoge 's `` junk '' allows him to use his voice as a resource and to show some acting quality . <sssss> in `` the notebook '' he was able to highlight ; but it was difficult here , probably in the main role , looking like a destroyed jonathan tucker and with don cheadle by his side . <sssss> the black man did n't go far here ; it was alright . <sssss> as i was saying at the beginning : the movie has nice music , is fresh , original , well acted , and other stuff you 'll see ; but it is not a good film . <sssss> gian , it is not good at all .
