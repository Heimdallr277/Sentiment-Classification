ur2480402/		\tt0113481		7		i was born in 1976 , so i sort of grew up with wiliam gibsons cyberpunk stories . <sssss> this particular movie would maybe have benefited from being `` neuromancer '' instead which , after all , was gibsons big hit . <sssss> it is a good story but i think all the violence and fights ruins it a bit . <sssss> it is clearly inspired by `` blade runner '' , and it is made before `` the matrix '' . <sssss> anyway , keanu reeves is very good in the lead role , and there are interesting parts by udo kier , dolph lundgren , henry rollins and ice-t . <sssss> it is a good fantasy story which anticipates some of the things that has all ready happened now in 2010 , so it is highly recommended if you are a fan of the fantasy genre . 
ur2480402/		\tt0090859		4		this movie has good performances by sylvester stallone and the guy from hellraiser but other than that it is a pretty awful movie with a lot of senseless violence . <sssss> the so-called cult is given no justification or meaning at all . <sssss> scene after scene takes place without any coherence to the one before . <sssss> the dane brigitte nielsen looks good in this movie but her performance is perhaps not so convincing . <sssss> all things considered , this movie just seems like a big ego-trip for sylvester , and it does work . <sssss> he is great in all the scenes he is in but the context is pretty horrible . <sssss> i know it sounds like a cliché to be against meaningless violence in films but this movie really has too much of that . <sssss> it is ugly and stupid to look at . 
ur2480402/		\tt0450385		4		this is a typical horror movie of that period . <sssss> the of american horror at the time was to not make scary movies and this movie is not scary either . <sssss> obviously the swedish director knows nothing what so ever about the horror genre which is also obvious from the director commentary on the dvd . <sssss> this movie is a joke . <sssss> cusack does a great job , but the only scary scene in the movie is towards the end with samuel jackson in a car . <sssss> all things considered , these are the kinds of horror movies that makes horror not worth seeing . <sssss> sad thing is one can almost sense that they try to get all kinds of other genres in it , even bragging about it , how it is `` funny '' and how it is `` good drama '' and good `` character-building '' but the horror element is totally neglected .

ur0217478/		\tt0057012		10		unlike other stanley kubrick films , which often need repeat viewings before i completely get them , this one i got right on the first try . <sssss> and okay , so the cold war is over -lrb- though i 'm sure there are people in america who still wish they had communism as a straw man -rrb- . <sssss> with nuclear weapons still out there , and the chances of terrorist groups of all kinds being able to get their hands on them , and the gun mentality which pervades the militaries of the world , this is still timely and hilariously funny , as it shows the people in charge for the idiots that they are . <sssss> sure , it 's cynical , but would n't you be ? <sssss> sellers , of course , deserves to be commended , and slim pickens assured his place in history with his riding the bomb down like a horse . <sssss> george c. scott , sterling hayden , and keenan wynn , however , usually get overlooked , and they 're equally funny without ever trying to be . <sssss> a masterpiece . 
ur0217478/		\tt0126250		10		it 's hard to believe a film this sunny came from robert altman , and is also this good , but there you go . <sssss> while i love some of his films , like m * a * s * h , mccabe and mrs. miller , nashville , the player , and short cuts , there are times when i feel he has a fundamental contempt for his subject matter , like in the long goodbye and popeye , and for his characters . <sssss> but while this movie , well-written by anne rapp , is essentially a tennessee williams drama turned inside out -lrb- glenn close 's character is the only one who seems like a refugee from williams territory -rrb- , we instead feel a great deal for each of the characters . <sssss> even close 's camille , whose machinations end up in the temporary jailing of an innocent man for a crime that never was , is somewhat likable . <sssss> when altman is on , we really get a sense of community and place , as opposed to movies which are just a triumph of production design , and this is no exception . <sssss> the best example of this is how lester -lrb- ned beatty -rrb- , a deputy sheriff , sums up his reasons for why willis -lrb- charles s. dutton -rrb- , that innocent man referred to earlier , is innocent of killing cookie -lrb- patricia neal -rrb- ; `` i fished with him . '' <sssss> in another movie , that line of reasoning would be ridiculous , but since you feel all of these people have known each other for years , it seems just right . <sssss> and the rhythms of the town feel right as well , so you do n't feel like you 're just watching a filmed set . <sssss> casting has always been a hallmark of altman films , and this one is no different . <sssss> charles s. dutton is as good as they say , being more restrained than usual , close shows great comic timing in her role , and julianne moore is very good as her put-upon younger sister , who has a lot more to her than meets the eye . <sssss> and altman regulars like beatty and lyle lovett are quite good as well . <sssss> the most surprising turns came from liv tyler and chris o'donnell . <sssss> i 've liked tyler before -lrb- in heavy , empire records , and that thing you do ! <sssss> -rrb- , but to imagine her with shorn hair playing a rebel who skins fish for a living was a bit much , to say the least , but she 's utterly convincing . <sssss> o'donnell has always seemed too callow , but here he 's quite funny as a deputy sheriff who 's seen way too many cop shows . <sssss> and he and tyler have nice chemistry together . 
ur0217478/		\tt0167404		8		first of all , i 've read a few comments about the pace of this movie being too slow . <sssss> i sort of agree with that , but i think it 's refreshing to have a movie which takes its time and builds things with subtlety -lrb- although here , as i said before , i think it took a little too much time -rrb- . <sssss> and i think it was realistic at how long it took for the boy to learn to trust the doctor and for how long it took the doctor to discover what was really going on . <sssss> having said all that , in addition to the pace , there were some times when i felt a little queasy , like i was n't sure what exactly the movie was trying to say . <sssss> at other times , i was caught up in it , especially in the performances of willis and osment . <sssss> then came the famous twist ending , and i will tell you that i was quite surprised , and it 's making me turn the movie over and over again in my mind . <sssss> i probably will have to see this again . <sssss> overall , while i do n't think it 's the best of the year , it is a good film . 
ur0217478/		\tt0119345		4		i concur with all the comments that say read the novel by lois duncan instead . <sssss> it 's true williamson and director jim gillespie were probably right to ditch the killer , since while it worked in the book , it probably would n't work in the movie . <sssss> but they also take away character development , emotional involvement , and even logic , and substitute cliches -lrb- ironic how williamson plays straight the same cliches he mocked in scream '' -rrb- . <sssss> and while it 's true both guy parts are nothing special , phillipe and prinze are pretty bad , so you do n't care at all what happens to them . <sssss> i 'm a big fan of `` buffy the vampire slayer '' and a fan of `` party of five '' , so i like sarah michelle gellar and jennifer love hewitt , respectively . <sssss> they do try their best , and hewitt at least has something to work with , but it 's not enough . <sssss> oh , and anne heche at least distinguishes herself .

'' <sssss> . <sssss> it is so comprehensible , what she 's going through . <sssss> we believe her when she talks to m : `` you 're my first love ; i 'll never forget you '' . <sssss> great job . <sssss> when they are both together on the screen , they are n't even together . <sssss> they are a few steps away . <sssss> and when they talk , they barely look at each other ; they do n't have emotion in their voices . <sssss> but ... why should they , if that 's one of the movie 's strong points . <sssss> it all fits in with the story and with what 's prepared for the characters . <sssss> it 's all united . <sssss> and do n't even speak about the score . <sssss> adequate for each time , coloring the blue -lrb- it 's a color but you know what i mean -rrb- scenes in a very special and original way . <sssss> and they fit with the movie too , because the tunes are played by real persons most of the times ; street musicians , bands ... little details that count . <sssss> it 's a movie from finland . <sssss> it 's a silent movie . <sssss> it 's a movie about people and reality . <sssss> it 's a movie with subtle but amazing performances . <sssss> it 's awkward . <sssss> it 's not great . <sssss> it 's from europe ; there 's something different so far . 
ur4751428/		\tt0112641		9		during its first forty minutes , martin scorsese 's `` casino '' is pure narration , except for little spoken moments . <sssss> it 's a risky move , but then marty has always been risky , and this movie may be the ultimate example to prove it . <sssss> closing in at three hours duration time , it takes its characters on a roller-coaster ride that not everyone might appreciate ; from the advantages of recurrent fortune to the regular scorsese 's cutting it short , because there 's a lot in the middle , but without telling you ` what ' exactly goes on in `` casino '' , i 'll tell you how you can approach it as a film . <sssss> when sam rothstein -lrb- robert de niro -rrb- is put in charge of the tangiers casino in las vegas , he sees it as the perfect chance to erase the obscure past we call carry with us . <sssss> however , his best friend nicky -lrb- joe pesci -rrb- is not fond of legitimacy ; and when he settles in vegas to protect him , it 's not long until he starts doing some business of his own . <sssss> as nicky himself puts it : `` the dollar ... always the dollar '' . <sssss> but if we go back , nicky also expresses at the beginning : `` it was perfect . <sssss> sam was the perfect guy to run the casino and he had me , his best friend , and ginger , the woman he loved '' . <sssss> we see ginger -lrb- a monumental sharon stone -rrb- at first as sam sees her , a light in the middle of the room -lrb- there 's one scene where this translates literally in images , with robert richardson 's contains a wonderful use of the rest of the room in a mild darkness , while de niro stands in awe as stone walks and works the room accompanied by a constant light -rrb- , but she is actually the most complex character of the film . <sssss> if you approach `` casino '' as a movie to see the inside movement of the casino business and its ups and downs -lrb- a subject the film manages perfectly -rrb- , you may not notice the complexity of stone 's character and her performance . <sssss> but then , if you view the film as the study of the consequences of an arranged marriage and life , you might miss the best element of the film : joe pesci 's creation of nicky ; something that 's indeed better than his work in `` goodfellas '' . <sssss> ultimately , you may choose to take `` casino '' as the story of a long-time friendship and the betrayals that come with the years because people change and want different things from life . <sssss> again , this -lrb- as the marriage thing -rrb- is a subject that the film dominates . <sssss> that 's how brilliant nicholas 's - together with of his own book is ; it covers everything with every detail . <sssss> they did the same thing with `` goodfellas '' and it was so rich that you could get lost in the ` mafia ' universe . <sssss> here , as in `` '' -lrb- both film share many similarities , more than anything in the ongoing decay of certain characters and images that seem obvious copies from the 1990 film and speak by themselves , about how great both movies are and that these similarities do n't change that fact at all -rrb- , you have to try to follow every plot line in order to witness every scene exactly as what it means in the movie . <sssss> it 's the only way you 'll enjoy the many conversations between sam and nick that lie between the best of the film and , besides showing that de niro is the best when it comes to calming someone down and/or persuading him to make another decision ; but pesci is better because his stubbornness allows him to evade discussions and therefore cause the other more trouble -lrb- also that both know each other by heart so the work together is pure pleasure -rrb- , are crucial to its development . <sssss> the narration comes and goes during the film , in present or past time , generating more confusion for the viewer . <sssss> this is all after the first hour and a half , and if you 're not hypnotized by the film 's spell at that point , something must be wrong . <sssss> is the movie too long ? <sssss> yes , if the spell did n't work on you ; but if you 're already connected with the characters and do n't want to get out , it makes no difference if it lasts three or five hours .

ur4751428/		\tt1305806		9		in my country , juan josé campanella is synonym of ` cinema of the highest order ' . <sssss> the director works in usa and from time to time he brings a new film . <sssss> we know , dramatically , what we 're going to watch : ricardo darín in an important role , a lot of sentimentalism , references to the country 's past , a love story . <sssss> and technically , if it 's the highest order , there wo n't be any complaints . <sssss> when the film ended , the people in the movie theater started clapping . <sssss> `` el secreto de sus ojos '' tells the story of benjamín esposito -lrb- darín -rrb- and his need to tell the story of a case that was n't completely solved 25 years ago and had an important impact in his life . <sssss> a woman raped and killed and a husband with the surname morales -lrb- pablo rago -rrb- who went every day to every train station in buenos aires to see if he could find the killer . <sssss> `` you have to see his eyes ; they are in a state of pure love '' , benjamín professes in front of irene hastings -lrb- soledad villamil -rrb- ; his boss and the woman he loves . <sssss> there are things we never forget , campanella knows well , and that might be the film 's most important declaration . <sssss> we expect from the director a powerful love that grows with the years , as we saw with darín and villamil in `` el amor , la lluvia '' ; we expect characters with inner ghosts , things to hide and things to hold on to ; we expect total control over the language of the environment -lrb- in `` el amor ... '' it was a magazine staff , in `` luna de avellaneda '' the neighborhood club -rrb- , a knowledge of the customs and the way of speaking of characters that makes for day-to-day comedy . <sssss> in this aspect , the casting of guillermo francella as pablo sandoval is crucial . <sssss> taking the place of the best friend role always in charge of fernando blanco , the comedian plays a drunk with a lot of respect for friendship . <sssss> his change of look , the measurement of his composition and how he enlightens it with comic touches make for one of the year 's best performances . <sssss> that 's about everything we can expect . <sssss> the fact is `` el secreto de sus ojos '' is a very good movie because there are things we do n't see coming . <sssss> the film contains a treatment of a police investigation that has n't been seen in our cinema for years . <sssss> in his riskiest picture , campanella flirts with thriller , mystery and real action -lrb- handy-cam included -rrb- ; he acquires true tension and a sequence in a soccer stadium is the best example of it . <sssss> he understands when silence is required and when the loneliness of the characters -- each of them with a rich , mysterious private and inner world - must be seen fully . <sssss> it 's quite embarrassing in fact , because darín as a director tried to achieve something like that with `` la '' . <sssss> even though it 's obvious campanella took no inspiration from that film , everything that went wrong there can be seen here , improved . <sssss> and soledad villamil is no femme fatale . <sssss> i take a risk , however , and defy you to tell me if , because of image and makeup resemblance , and disposition of images and voice in off , the movie towards the finish line does n't take direct inspiration from chris nolan 's `` the prestige '' . <sssss> it 's quoting it somehow , at least . <sssss> it 's very moving to watch excellent performances from recognized actors . <sssss> we 've seen them on screen so much , we know what they do , we admire them and respect them and , as with campanella , we tend to know what to expect . <sssss> however , sometimes they enchant us with every face in every frame , with every word in every conversation . <sssss> i 'm trying to explain to you the feeling of what villamil and darín do in this film : it 's enchanting and contagious , purely human -lrb- as it occurred in `` el amor ... '' -rrb- , but at the same time moving , simply because they 're not unprofessional actors that fit in the look of the film , or young actors with expressive faces , or newcomers that take our breath away : they are ricardo darín and soledad villamil . <sssss> campanella has a lot to do with this , because he knows how to make them work together and he made an effort so they would not repeat what they had given us in the other film i 've mentioned . <sssss> the fact that fernando did n't write the film calls our attention ; the script was written by the director and eduardo sacheri . <sssss> it also calls our attention that campanella himself edited the movie . <sssss> is this film-making of the highest order ? <sssss> i believe so , in our country , and speaking of something commercially successful too . <sssss> it 's the only movie seen by many people that can generate interest in revising the director 's previous work and , who knows , maybe other national pieces . 
ur4751428/		\tt0381061		8		james bond movies are not just about bond ... it 's bond and the action , bond and the fights , bond and the cars , bond and the martinis , bond and the villains bond and the girls . <sssss> `` casino royale '' has all this elements and uses them brilliantly and for that simple reason it is the best bond movie i 've seen in my life ; considering i have n't watched all of them . <sssss> maybe it was the fact that i truly detested pierce brosnan 's arrogance , or that the action was too heavy , or that things did n't make much sense ; but i just could n't enjoy the last emissions of the saga . <sssss> `` casino royale '' , with its long duration and different settings , becomes thoroughly enjoyable . <sssss> a big part of this result occurs because the action scenes are mostly short and exciting , until the last sequence , which is a satisfying climax that you can tolerate and appreciate . <sssss> i believe that `` die another day '' , for example , was too over the top in every element , but it 's not difficult to notice the perfect balance here . <sssss> take the plot , with its simple development of a mission we do n't have to analyze much , and wittily scripted love relationship , accurately managed by the leading stars . <sssss> and i must say that it is a film with well-drawn patterns ; the villain is a bad man with his beautiful woman and a huge boat sailing in the ocean ... talk about good cliché usage . <sssss> and the technical work is masterful . <sssss> the camera looks like taken from an old movie , with elegant and easy shots , so the film looks old and consequently everything does ; the edition , the chilling score and the general mood that generates a contradiction , because the devices used by agents are as modern as ever but the environment is not . <sssss> however , the true magic lies in the agent himself : bond . <sssss> director martin campbell understood his task and made `` casino royale '' so we could see that this was the beginning of his work as a double 0 agent ... how does he do this ? <sssss> details , for example : in persecuting a fast running man at the beginning of the film , bond does n't have the ability to jump from the highest roof without getting injured ; so he uses what he has around him because he is intelligent , but when he does jump he gets hurt . <sssss> on another side , he makes such stupid mistakes due to his ego . <sssss> but it is a human ego ; and daniel craig 's performance captures it in a breeze of fresh air that leave pierce brosnan 's portrayals looking like something coming out of a perfect robot . <sssss> the same goes for eva green , who manages her chemistry with craig in order to look not just like the beautiful woman she is , but also as a human being capable of showing true love that refuses to be another disposable bond element . <sssss> there 's one scene where they both have a conversation in a train , analyzing each other ... did i enjoy that scene ! <sssss> i did n't enjoy some performances because they did n't convince me , but i smiled during the action sequences and during so many moments that i just stopped thinking about it . <sssss> there 's a new level of action films , prequels or eternal sequels or something like that ... nolan 's `` batman begins '' , stallone 's `` rocky balboa '' , lee 's `` inside man '' , i heard the new `` die hard '' was good ... watch them all ! 
ur4751428/		\tt0366627		7		where does this movie come from ? <sssss> a story by someone who had never done anything before , a script by a someone who 'd only written one thing before it , a director who had made nothing noticeable but a fictional biography of a british painter ... `` the jacket '' deserves credit already for coming from somekind of darkness , and that 's what gives the film an extra point . <sssss> the film is an unexpected surprise ; a flawed tale about the deepest fears of the human mind . <sssss> it 's flawed because it could have known better and had all the elements for it . <sssss> we meet sergeant jack starks -lrb- adrien brody -rrb- when he tells us he has died , but we see him alive again . <sssss> he walks through the snow and finds a little girl named jackie and her mother jane with their car stopped in the road . <sssss> he helps them , then he asks for a lift and gets into a guy 's car ; a policeman stops them . <sssss> next thing we know , jack is being accused of murder and charged innocent because of ` mental problems ' . <sssss> he 's sent to a clinic , an institution , a hospital , call it whatever you want . <sssss> maybe it 's too much to take for a few minutes , but this is the way it happens . <sssss> later in the clinic one could think that jack will go crazy , like rambo crazy , because he 's been in the war and all that . <sssss> but this does n't happen , and if you try to figure `` the jacket '' out leaving its simplicity aside , you may arrive to a lot of different conclusions . <sssss> i 've seen crazy , you 've seen crazy : the patients of `` one flew over the cuckoo 's nest '' , the girls in `` girl interrupted '' . <sssss> it 's different here : craziness is rarely seen -lrb- specifically in a character played scarily by daniel craig -rrb- and in one point director john maybury uses it merely as an instrument to get to a crucial part of the movie . <sssss> there 's a jacket , and it will take jack to the future so he can try to figure out what happened to him . <sssss> if i have to be honest , this ` time-travel ' approach seems to be the film 's main preoccupation , and it works . <sssss> but what 's the problem ? <sssss> it 's too easy , too convenient , too planned . <sssss> jack meets two fundamental individuals at the hospital : dr. becker -lrb- kris kristofferson ... he 's great -rrb- and dr. beth lorenson -lrb- the infallible jennifer jason leigh -rrb- ; and he 'll meet them again in the future , and they 'll be surprised and you can try to guess what happens . <sssss> if you watch `` the jacket '' taking only this approach into consideration , you will be entertained but you should be disappointed . <sssss> that 's why i looked at some other things and other movies came to mind . <sssss> `` the i inside '' , with its intensive use of resources to leave the viewer clear that a man was going nuts and an also intensive dramatic feeling that sometimes was laughable ; `` the butterfly effect '' , daring and unstoppable , but more measured and truly worried about characters . <sssss> in both of those movies , the main characters travel through time , and everything seems quite frenetic . <sssss> not here : maybury makes sure there 's not an excessive use of the score or the musical supervision that may have introduced unnecessary songs ; he respects silence and does n't abuse of ` time-traveling ' resources . <sssss> the other key is brody 's performance : his humane composition of jack never indicates someone about to explode . <sssss> this guy stares , speaks quietly and with long pauses , seems confused and down to earth about the sort of gift he 's been given . <sssss> i have n't even mentioned that while going back and forth in time , he falls in love with the same little girl -lrb- now older -rrb- he helped on the road before , jackie , played by a stupendous keira knightley that grows slowly into love , delivering a performance that starts from a very deep bottom , morally speaking , and culminates between the clouds . <sssss> as i see it and said it -lrb- because the movie deserves the detailed analysis -rrb- , `` the jacket '' is a flawed tale about the deepest fears of the human mind , like death . <sssss> flawed because it wastes a tremendous ensemble that gives their best , flawed because it misleads the viewer with a story that 's simpler than it appears to be . <sssss> but its flaws contain a bid deal of optimism . <sssss> `` the jacket '' believes in love and is sure that death may not be so bad and scary . <sssss> there 's a moment during which the darkness the movie came from and took place , turns to light . <sssss> it may make you smile .

and how good a person can be , even when he or she is a bit crazy . <sssss> i came to the conclusion that the three main characters of `` the piano '' are good hearted people , but with big mental issues ... but that 's just one of the layers of the film . <sssss> set in the 1850 's , the story follows ada -lrb- holly hunter -rrb- and her daughter -lrb- anna paquin -rrb- flora , as they travel to new zealand , where alisdair stewart -lrb- sam neil -rrb- , an intended husband she has n't met , is waiting for ada to begin a life with her . <sssss> ada -lrb- she explains to us during a narration at the beginning of the film where her mind is speaking -rrb- is mute and plays the piano , so when she arrives to the beach , her piano is loaded down but stewart refuses to take it to the house ; so they leave it on the beach . <sssss> there will be one person who will help her get the piano back , and that 's baines -lrb- harvey keitel -rrb- , and that 's the development of the film about which i ca n't say no more . <sssss> the way ada looks at the piano -lrb- it is worth putting in capital letters because it 's another main character -rrb- on the beach when she 's on top of the hill as she walks to the house ; that 's the main element of the contemplation present in jane campion 's direction . <sssss> not only that beautiful shot of the lonely piano on the beach , but the way she pays attention to the jungle or the houses , when the camera shows empty spaces ; in a metaphorical way that really seems to be saying something . <sssss> that 's another magical element : let 's call it `` unexplained understanding '' . <sssss> through campion 's astonishing script is that we also see the layers i 'm talking about . <sssss> she covers a lot in such few words that holly hunter 's look is enough to understand what 's going on . <sssss> believe it or not , i 'm getting stuck with this review ; but because i have many things to say . <sssss> the intense character study is something from another world . <sssss> campion , both in her direction and script , makes sure that every scene has total importance , without differentiating between a main character like ada or an aboriginal from new zealand . <sssss> every scene is so intense with the focus on the characters that you ca n't keep your eyes off the screen , even when the film is slow and depressing like no other . <sssss> whether it is in the house , on the beach or inside the jungle , each scene takes the action from ten different angles with a big number of different shots . <sssss> this is stuart dryburgh 's flawless achievement in cinematography ; which includes close-ups so daring and compelling as the ones he uses now , more than ten years later , in films like `` the painted veil '' . <sssss> i ca n't forget about michael nyman 's score , which is not the best thing in the world , but is perfectly combined with every piece ada plays in her beloved piano ; in order to give a continuing musicality to the picture . <sssss> now , i do n't know how much nyman wrote of these pieces ada play , but ... the moments in which she plays each of them and the way she does it and how the pieces sound ; i could assure that they represent ada 's feelings in their most original form . <sssss> i mean , i do n't know much about classical music and that 's what i 'm saying . <sssss> however , if those pieces existed and were at least known , their title or -lrb- as i said -rrb- their form would be incredibly connected to campion 's story . <sssss> i do n't even know how much campion knows about music , but if she does n't know anything , it did n't affect this beautiful piece at all . <sssss> realize how much i 've said about `` the piano '' and i have n't even mentioned the performances . <sssss> i should n't have to , though : holly hunter won a well-deserved oscar for her performance here and it is as simple as it sounds ; she does n't speak a word . <sssss> little anna paquin , who is know big and talented , was also incredibly talented then with ten years old ; and she also got an oscar for it . <sssss> she could n't even watch the film when this happened because she was too young , and apparently she has n't completely watched it yet . <sssss> sam neil achieves a remarkable job with a character that requires several big changes of mood and decisions ; and that angry actor that harvey keitel is presents an unexpected gentleness as the troubled baines . <sssss> but as i already mentioned ; they are all somehow very troubled . <sssss> and between this troubled and frightening and confusing and violent environment , ada sits down and speaks , through her piano ; that , as a colleague of mine said , is her own voice . 
ur4751428/		\tt0089853		7		already from the beginning , woody allen was working on characters . <sssss> in `` the purple rose of cairo '' , a very young jeff daniels plays two characters : an actor named gil shepherd and a character shepherd plays for the movie of the title , called tom baxter . <sssss> needless to say the actor daniel portrays is also a character , therefore we 're talking of studying characters inside characters ; which is precisely what allen does in this movie that also contains another movie inside of it . <sssss> do n't you ever wonder what it would be like ? <sssss> being in hollywood , doing an important motion picture ? <sssss> or the other things you wonder while watching a film : if the characters could really exist , if they are real enough for us to connect with them . <sssss> there is a rapidly spoken phrase in `` the purple rose of cairo '' that could easily explain what allen was trying to achieve with the piece , and something that 's also a simple truth : `` the fictional characters want to live in the real life , and the real people want to be inside a movie '' . <sssss> both things occur in this film , as cecilia -lrb- mia farrow -rrb- , a movie lover , escapes with adventurer tom baxter , who suddenly during the projection of the film -lrb- which , as it 's been clarified , shares the title with the actual film we 're talking about -rrb- looks at the screen and tells her : `` you must really love this movie '' . <sssss> it was the beginning of cinema ; a film was showed in theatres for a week and it was the only thing you had . <sssss> cecilia goes to watch the movie in question a few times , and the fifth time , this character jumps off the screen and takes her with him , to see her city . <sssss> some time later , he 'll take her back , and they 'll both be together on the screen , in black and white , walking the streets of allen 's beloved manhattan . <sssss> in essence , the plot description is simple . <sssss> cecilia is unhappily married with monk -lrb- a brilliant performance by danny aiello -rrb- and finds in the movie character played daniels a fresh breeze of romanticism she 's never experienced . <sssss> but then the real actor comes into the picture and things get complicated . <sssss> that is what allen 's script describes and what occupies most of his movie . <sssss> however , cecilia is no fool , and is aware of the improbable nature of her situation . <sssss> that 's why , at times , after tom baxter says something beautiful to her , she responds : `` that 's movie talk '' . <sssss> farrow is great at evoking a sense of admiration with her big wide eyes and at interrupting this sort of naivety abruptly to face her husband . <sssss> but then there 's this other thing , that is more than a romantic story and every girl 's dream come true tale , and has to do with characters speaking from the screen to an audience sitting on a movie theater . <sssss> what is this ? <sssss> what are they saying ? <sssss> for brief instants and with the comedic touch that allen dominates , in the long time the characters of `` the purple rose of cairo '' wait for baxter to come back , they discuss people , relationships , social status and hollywood . <sssss> i wonder what would happen if a movie we know by heart changed its structure , if characters rebelled and disappeared from a film . <sssss> in this aspect , allen is making a parody and a homage at the same time , to hollywood . <sssss> a parody because he introduces a character who is a producer and goes mad when finding out his movie characters are jumping off the screen ; a parody because the characters on the screen are so used to do the same thing every time that they ca n't understand how something has changed . <sssss> and a homage when , for example , a character on screen who 's a waiter learns that everything is being improvised and , all of a sudden starts to dance ; a homage because when cecilia watches fred astaire singing `` cheek to cheek '' and we understand that watching movies is like being in heaven . <sssss> but i still do wonder what would really happen if a movie , one of the few timeless possessions of our times , unexpectedly changed . <sssss> i would probably steal a phrase from a moviegoer that goes to watch `` the purple rose of cairo '' : `` i want what happened in the movie last week to happen this week ; otherwise , what 's life all about anyway ? '' <sssss> . <sssss> i imagine you would also agree with her .

ur0116181/		\tt0141941		10		this film is unavoidably being compared to director alan j. pakula 's `` all the president 's men '' and for good reason , because michael mann 's new film is every bit as good . <sssss> -lrb- anybody is the tv news biz - like me - knows that newspaper and tv news are very different animals . <sssss> -rrb- `` the insider '' is a very mature film . <sssss> it takes its sweet time letting the events unfold . <sssss> however mann and his team use very cinematic trick in the book to hold our attention and the editing is impeccable . <sssss> but first and foremost the film features 2 virtuoso performances : one by a master we 've grown accustomed to and one by a guy who may have joined his league . <sssss> of course i 'm talking about al pacino and russell crowe . <sssss> pacino adds another mammoth blast in his hall of fame collection of home run performances . <sssss> his portrayal of 60 minutes producer gives him a lot of room to use all his skills as an actor and he never ever looks like an actor acting . <sssss> he vents anger and frustration better than any actor i 've ever seen and he is given the chance to do so here . <sssss> now on to the `` new '' guy . <sssss> anybody who has seen russell crowe before -lrb- especially in his oscar-worthy effort in `` l.a. confidential '' -rrb- is not surprised that he can more than hold his own against pacino , but then again acting is not a sporting event and there is room for a lot of winners in a movie like this . <sssss> crowe 's role as `` the guy '' who blows the whistle on the tobacco industry is a fascinating study of a man imploding . <sssss> not since pacino 's work in `` the godfather ii '' have i 've seen it done so well . <sssss> like every other thing mann has done the supporting actors are great too , but the standout here is christopher plummer 's mike wallace who has to reluctantly sell out to the corporate bottom line . <sssss> the story about a guy who wants to go public about a major public health crime but is abandoned by a major network is complex and difficult stuff , but mann and co-scripter eric roth do a magnificent job at keeping it clear and interesting . <sssss> it is riveting and important entertainment . <sssss> like the phrase `` tv journalism '' , `` important entertainment '' may seem like a contradiction of terms , but not with this movie which is one the best films of the year .

ur4234119/		\tt0070290		10		hal ashby ... whoever remembers this name , probably drown in the flood of directorial talents that survived the new hollywood era like scorsese , coppola , lucas or spielberg . <sssss> yet , like friedkin , bogdanovich or peckinpah , ashby is one of the most underrated and emblematic film-makers of his era , not quite underrated because his movies actually outlived by the remembrance of his name : `` harold and maude '' , `` being there '' , `` bound for glory '' -lrb- the fifth best picture nominee of 1976 -rrb- and of course `` the last detail '' , a gripping male-bonding comedy-drama that encapsulates the rebellious and fatalistic flavor of its time and served by one of jack nicholson 's greatest performances as navy first class signalman bill ` bad-ass ' buddusky . <sssss> the film 's spirit it perfectly captured in its iconic poster : nicholson with a sailor hat , a defying look and a charismatic pose holding his cigar as to exhilarate the perpetuate thrill of free-spirited and insubordination , as a man who does n't get obedience and submission mixed up , his looks clearly express the fact that he does n't take it from anybody . <sssss> and the tag-line -lrb- jesus h. christ , what a tag-line ! <sssss> -rrb- says it better than any summary : `` no * # @ !! <sssss> * navy 's going to give some poor ** !! <sssss> @ * kid eight years in the # @ ! <sssss> * brig without me taking him out for the time of his * # @ !! <sssss> * life '' -lrb- needless to say that profanity is as ubiquitous as god in the bible -rrb- . <sssss> the ` tag-line ' kid is larry meadows , randy quaid as a young sailor who 's going to serve 8 years in portsmouth naval prison for having stolen money from a charity box belonging to the wife of a superior officer , we easily get that the sentence would 've been lighter for another ` victim ' . <sssss> buddusky and otis young as mulhall aka ` mule ' are assigned to escort him . <sssss> they have one week on their hands and a poor psychologically unstable and -lrb- obviously -rrb- kleptomaniac 18-year old kid who never had any fun in his life , and is nowhere near having it . <sssss> so that 's `` the last detail '' in a nutshell , three men and a limited trajectory : from norfolk where the assignment was given to portsmouth where the delivery would be done . <sssss> orders are limited in space and in time : one week . <sssss> one week before jail , like edward norton 's last day before jail in spike lee 's `` 25th hour '' and with a lesser sense of urgency , this week might be meadows 's last opportunity to have his share of fun and to get the spirit ` in him ' . <sssss> of course , this spirit is carried by nicholson in a tailor-made role , only followed by meadows because he 's handcuffed and mule because he 's ` in the same boat ' . <sssss> badass is the joker , mule the straight-man and meadows in the middle does n't know how to fit . <sssss> randy quaid delivers a remarkable performance as a poor vulnerable kid victim of circumstances and a perfect counterpart to badass ' exuberance and flamboyant personality . <sssss> no wonder that badass would try to teach him how to get mad at things or get them the way he wants . <sssss> both actors would be oscar-nominated for their performances . <sssss> that 's what i love with these 70 's films , they reflected the atmosphere of their era with a raw authenticity and gritty realism without distracting the viewers from the many purpose of being entertained or let 's just say , spend a good time and learn one thing or two about a guy , a woman or a bunch of people . <sssss> i ca n't think of a more humanistic period movie-wise than this decade with `` the last detail '' as one of its highlights . <sssss> you have three men who belong to the military side during probably the most anti-military era ever ; they incarnate the very establishment they hate themselves , yet they remain faithful to a sort of moral code . <sssss> they have fun within their own group , drink beer and bang whores , but rules still exist . <sssss> and while we 're transported by the poignant sight of the young meadows haplessly skating on the ice rink , we know that sooner or later , we 'll be reminded of that goddamn assignment . <sssss> but one ca n't deny the impact a bigger-than-life personality like buddusky would have on a submissive character like meadows , while not being a character study a la `` five easy pieces '' , we expect from meadows ' youthful naivety that the film would depict a coming-of-age , if only for the incredible bar scene that echoes bobby 's chicken salad moment , when buddusky asks for a beer to the under-aged sailor . <sssss> he protests not because it 's unfair but because he thinks that a guy who had the hardest time of his life coming is adult enough to get some privileges . <sssss> we accept this logic and feel for both buddusky and meadows . <sssss> `` it 's not in him '' says mule , referring to this spirit buddusky tries to inculcate , but the intelligence in the script is that whatever sickness stroke meadows , we feel that the cure would be much worse . <sssss> the script , written by robert towne , who 'd win an oscar for chinatown one year later reflects the paradoxical approach to rules and authority during the post-vietnam era , incarnated by the navy trio , each one being more complex than what he seems at first . <sssss> the script is also one of the film 's strengths in the way it feels absolutely real and genuine , without any cliché , and allows each of the character to shine and to make us feel for them or for the kind of persons they were , and the kind of cities they grew in , like the north east to which the film delivers a sober but no less appealing painting . <sssss> in fact this film made in 1973 makes me wonder in , when people will ask about the 's , which movies i would recommend -lrb- if i 'm still alive -rrb- . <sssss> now that cinema traded its dignity for money , 3d , special effects and stories , where have gone all the true authors eager to express their view of life , on the world ? <sssss> where have all the ` hal ashby 's gone goddammit ?

<sssss> the story is centered on one character : jimmy `` the saint '' portrayed by the great andy garcia as an ex-criminal , one who redeemed himself , and runs now a very particular business . <sssss> this , tarantino did n't invent , and no other movies did , there 's at least one inventive element we might concede to the film . <sssss> the business consists on making testimonial clips of people about to die , letting some posthumous advice and to their beloved ones . <sssss> this ` after-world ' business , not only maintains the feeling that these dead persons are still alive , but works as a great plot element driving the film . <sssss> the various real-life situations featured in denver 's neighborhoods are accompanied with these lessons , like one about the magic of the first date when jimmy was in the restaurant with the exquisite dagney , played by gabrielle anwar . <sssss> the whole film is punctuated with short but moving intermission about girls , life , death and love ... and the whole story is like another illustration of these life lessons . <sssss> jimmy 's pivotal life moment occurs when he 's approached by two thugs who work for , christopher walken in my favorite of his villainous roles . <sssss> jimmy has a debt with : regrettable omission for an unconventional mission . <sssss> it 's the kind of missions you do n't know if it 's so simple , it will work or so screwed up it will inevitably fail . <sssss> 's dim-witted son bernard , psychologically hurt by a painful break-up , was seen attacking a little girl in the playground , the guy is no pedophile though , just so mentally ill he tries to reach love by the most desperate ways . <sssss> he 's a pathetic victim , he lost his mother in an accident , and his surviving father has such a weird perception of love , he asks jimmy and his men , to discourage the boyfriend of bernard 's ex and convince her to go back to bernard . <sssss> what a schedule ! <sssss> and the team is one of the most irresistible aspects of the film , they 're all here : the unsung heroes of the gangster genre . <sssss> i mentioned `` once upon a time in america '' ... well , the movie reunites the great william forsythe as `` franchise '' the tattooed , and treat williams as the unforgettable `` critical '' bill , a man whose nickname is the understatement of the year . <sssss> i do n't want to spoil it for you , but williams is a show stealer in every single scene , as the man whose hobby it to ` work up ' by punching the dead bodies in the undertaking business he works in . <sssss> the rest of the team features bill nunn as `` easy wind '' and christopher lloyd , who makes a memorable come-back as `` pieces '' , the veteran , who works as a porn cinema projectionist struggling with his leprosy . <sssss> a cool and magnetic ensemble cast supported by other great roles including fairuza balk as lucinda , the whose only addiction that 's not a drug is her sincere love for jimmy , steve buscemi as the scary professional hit-man mr `` shh '' and last but not least , the late jack warden , as the one who tells us the story like an amusing anecdote , creating a feeling of intimacy and sympathy toward this colorful gallery . <sssss> this is the set-up of the film , a bunch of men asked to accomplish a last financially promising job before retirement , men who tries to turn their back to the past , each one in a personal way . <sssss> all they have to do is the job . <sssss> of course , when you get the idea of jimmy 's business and when you memorize the title , you understand that the film wo n't have the happiest cinematic ending ever ... not that it leaves you in a depressing mood though : the film actually `` glides '' with a beautiful view on life , so if you have n't seen it , just enter this world and let yourself transported by its script , so full of wit and beautiful metaphors about life , especially a very poignant one from christopher lloyd . <sssss> watch this film to finally get the meaning of `` buckwheat '' or `` boat drinks ! '' <sssss> and be among the privileged fans who embarked the boat of `` things to do in denver '' , a crime film whose only criminal aspect is to live forever in the shadow of `` pulp fiction '' and to be so severely underrated ... 
ur4234119/		\tt0046911		10		released in 1955 , `` diaboliques '' -lrb- translated as ` the devils ' -rrb- has often been described as the most feature film : this assessment is flattering as long as it does n't diminish the directorial talent of henri-george clouzot . <sssss> it 's true that henri-george clouzot 's psychological thriller features several archetypes that cemented the legend of the director . <sssss> much more , with a dead man in a bathtub -lrb- no spoiler , here -rrb- , a plot focusing less on the crime committed than its mysterious aftermath , a palpable sexual tension and a spectacular twist ending , the film has the most comparable plot to `` psycho '' . <sssss> however , the comparison overlooks that clouzot was already considered a master in the mystery and thriller genre , to which `` diaboliques '' blends both elements . <sssss> his heart-pounding `` wages of fear '' had already chilled the spine of viewers in all over the world . <sssss> so , no matter how close `` diaboliques '' is to `` psycho '' , it still was the first comer ... and in fact , without `` diaboliques '' , there would n't be `` psycho '' . <sssss> legend had it that clouzot bought the rights of the novel written by pierre boileau and thomas narcejac a few hours before hitch . <sssss> granted he was already an iconic director , there are chances that without `` psycho '' , everyone would have praised `` diaboliques '' as the most suspenseful and horrific thriller ever instead of any hitchcock 's film , so it 's very probable that the master of suspense took the case personally . <sssss> then `` diaboliques '' made a sensation in the united states , became the favorite film of robert block , who wrote `` psycho '' for hitch , the rest is history . <sssss> using a shower instead of a bathtub , the film borrows many elements from `` diaboliques '' including as spectacular climax : clouzot 's thriller is infamous for its anti- spoiler message at the end , begging the viewers not to be devilish and reveal the ending . <sssss> but the interest of `` diaboliques '' does n't rely on the ending only ; the film opens with an intriguing set of relationships that confine to ` triangular hatred ' . <sssss> vera clouzot is christina , a frail , sickly and insecure brunette , wife of michel delasalle , the headmaster of a provincial boarding school , played by the great paul meurisse , a tyrant with both kids and the teachers and a bully with his wife : the only area where she can control him is financial , she owns the school . <sssss> there is the obligatory mistress , played by simone signoret , who 's everything christina is not : blonde , sexy and commanding . <sssss> in this masterstroke of casting it 's easy to see in the contrast between the two women , the roots for a genuine attraction , signoret becomes ` manly ' with christina while christina is totally passionless regarding her marriage . <sssss> the talent of clouzot is to keep a cloud of ambiguity floating within the main atmosphere , thanks to a convincing yet misleading characterization . <sssss> vera clouzot might not be the greatest actress of her era , only remembered for her roles in `` diaboliques '' and `` wages of fear '' , she magnificently transcends her limited range into one of the most memorable and poignant movie performances with her constant nervousness , accent , and petite frame , towered by meurisse who 's described as a 5 ' 7 '' tall man , the typical mistreated woman . <sssss> when she consents to help nicole in the murder of her husband with nicole , the plan itself might be `` diabolique '' but i refused to tag christina with such an epithet , because after the murder is committed , the film climbs the ladder from a simple thriller to a masterpiece of horror and mystery . <sssss> indeed , never has the word ` heart pounding ' been so fitting to describe a thriller . <sssss> in `` diaboliques '' , christina suffers from a heart condition , which ironically meets reality because the real actress died five later of a heart attack . <sssss> but this device plays a pivotal role in the way her body responses to a series of strange occurrences ensuing the murder . <sssss> all through the film , the mystery suggests a sort of devilish presence , starting with a body dropped in the swimming pool waiting to float and make it appear like an accident , then disappearing , a silhouette in a photograph 's background . <sssss> the feeling of a set-up , intended to drive cristina into madness , reminds of another hitchcockian classic : `` gaslight '' , but with a darker undertone , more macabre , indeed more devilish . <sssss> i would n't go further , out of respect to clouzot who made his wish explicit at the end of the film , hoping no one would see the film after the dreadful remake , because 80 % of the legend - not the quality - that elevated `` diaboliques '' to its iconic status , depends on the gripping climax and the heart-pounding four minutes before . <sssss> but there is much more to say about the film , in terms of entertainment . <sssss> many philosophical words are used to describe clouzot 's films : existential , pessimistic , nihilistic etc. . <sssss> i suspect the man was beyond labels , and more eager to create sensational films . <sssss> he was a craftsman of cinematic experiences , providing the right levels of emotions with never being their slave . <sssss> clouzot 's films always featured a gallery of colorful characters , whom the viewers could identify with , and `` diaboliques '' is no exception : pierre , the elderly teacher , a young michel serrault , george , the kid from `` forbidden games '' , noël roquevert and on the top of all , the scene-stealing performance of charles vanel as fichet . <sssss> coming from nowhere , vanel is the man who asks the questions with the nonchalance of the friendly while his tendency to forget the questions hides his real goal which is to confront the people with their own contradictions . <sssss> as small as it was , fichet inspired one of the most beloved tv characters : `` columbo '' , another reason to thank clouzot for `` '' . <sssss> so , if you 're a fan of `` columbo '' , of `` hitchcock '' , of french cinema , of movies with twist endings , there 's no excuse not to see `` diaboliques '' , one of the best thrillers ever . 
ur4234119/		\tt0305224		7		in my opinion , a good comedy is built on an original premise and a funny story working as the build-up for a final and hilarious punch line . <sssss> and that 's what lacked in peter segal 's `` anger management '' , a pity because some scenes were not just funny , but flirted with comedic genius . <sssss> take the moment in the plane , when dave buznik -lrb- adam sandler -rrb- sits next to dr. buddy rydel -lrb- jack nicholson -rrb- , buddy laughs so loudly at a film and asks so many embarrassing questions that dave decides to watch the film for his own serenity . <sssss> he asks the flight attendant for a headset but she ignores him , he asks her again then she tells him to keep calm . <sssss> the scene works on many levels because it confirms dave 's calm and passive personality and exposes him to people who overreact for no reason . <sssss> an angry black flight 's sky marshal also asks dave to keep calm , dave is the poor unlucky schmuck whose tongue slips and makes him say `` what 's wrong with you people ? '' <sssss> notice that at that moment , buddy , the man who got him in trouble cowardly pretends to sleep . <sssss> it goes on and on , dave 's asked one time too many to keep calm , dave shouts `` i 'm calm ! '' <sssss> , the marshal immediately tasers him . <sssss> this whole scene is funny from its simple premise , a poor schmuck facing people who overreact while he 's obviously inoffensive , a situation that gets more and more out of control and the taser is the perfect punch line . <sssss> nothing is funnier than a man who is not angry , and asked to keep calm . <sssss> i know that because i could relate to the situation . <sssss> if only `` anger management '' kept the same pattern than this simple scene , it would have been one of the greatest comedies of the last decade . <sssss> imagine a man sentenced to anger management therapy while his biggest problem is precisely a lack of anger . <sssss> the film makes it clear that dave is abused by his boss , that he 's got a beautiful girlfriend linda but he ca n't kiss her in public because of his humiliation in the past and her ex-boyfriend regularly comes to tease dave . <sssss> he 's pressured in every side , and we feel for him : the last thing he needs is anger management . <sssss> does he ? <sssss> dave visits buddy for one séance , he meets other ` anonymous angry ' people , among them luis guzman , john turturro as chuck in a scene-stealing role and two horny lesbians . <sssss> dave plays the game and tries to answer buddy 's question `` tell us about you '' yet he never gives a proper answer , either he tells what he does , or what he expects , but he ca n't say who he is . <sssss> the film leaves it interestingly ambiguous whether it 's buddy who pushes dave off the edge or dave who has an anger problem . <sssss> anyhow , buddy delivers an implacable diagnosis : `` there are two kinds of angry people : implosive and explosive . <sssss> the explosive is the customer that keeps on yelling at the cashier for not taking his coupon . <sssss> the implosive is the cashier that keeps calm day after day till she snaps and murders all the people in the store . <sssss> you are the cashier . '' <sssss> and dave 's reply could n't have been more hilarious : `` oh no ! <sssss> i 'm not the cashier ! <sssss> i 'm the guy that 's hiding behind the frozen foods section dealing 911 ! '' <sssss> and we so believe him . <sssss> as soon as the flamboyant buddy and the straight-laced dave team up for the therapy , we feel that the film is unto something extremely promising . <sssss> acting-wise , it 's obvious that adam sandler does n't have the range of jack nicholson , but he 's playing a character that lacks charisma and the one-note tone creates the perfect contrast for an ` odd couple ' effect . <sssss> and dave 's jinx continues to follow him : in another hilarious scene , he 's involved in a bar fight provoked by chuck and ending up with dave hitting a poor mexican waiter with a cane . <sssss> later , dave explains to the judge -lrb- lynn in her last role -rrb- that he was just trying to take the cane from ... a blind man . <sssss> poor dave ! <sssss> the film is just one gag following another and when it 's not funny , it makes you smile , it owes a lot to nicholson 's ability to portray half psychotic half exuberant characters , even if it does indirectly highlight sandler 's limitations at some places ... but the film could have survived that . <sssss> the problem was more with the plot , while it seemed to go nowhere but still be being outrageously funny , it became desperately convention when we could see where it was going . <sssss> so , the whole therapy was just a wake-up call , an invitation for dave to overcome his fear and shyness . <sssss> all it took was for buddy to pretend to steal his fiancée and his idea of marriage proposal in the yankee stadium . <sssss> the film opens with the premise of a slapstick buddy-movie and an enjoyable little character study , it ends as an unoriginal rom-com . <sssss> and it would still have been ok if it was n't for all the 11 references and new york celebration ? <sssss> i mean , what the hell was rudolf giuliani doing there ? <sssss> was the film so desperate that it needed to play at a game even on a political field . <sssss> do n't get me wrong , the film was funny , and sometimes very funny and gripping in its won way but that was worst than the worst of product placement , the ending was just like thrown at our faces to tell us that it was n't meant to be serious . <sssss> the therapy was fake , so was the film though the ' i feel pretty ' was cute in its own non-sensical way . <sssss> i do n't mind not taking a film seriously , and watching it just to have a good laugh at some scenes or lines , but it 's a real pity a film shows so much potential and features so many hilarious lines . <sssss> `` the hangover '' did n't have a more original plot , but at least it was consistent . 
ur4234119/		\tt0042208		10		this is from louis as the crooked lawyer alonzo d. emmerich , aka ` uncle lon ' for marilyn monroe . <sssss> this sentence summarizes the very spirit that conducts thieves ' actions and alone elevates caper films as probably the most defining of all the crime sub-genres : it 's all about finding justifications for selfish actions . <sssss> indeed , the basis for crime is less vileness than selfishness , call it greed , personal accomplishment , money , it 's always egos talking . <sssss> a criminal is naturally selfish and the vileness is only the consequence of a visceral absence of empathy . <sssss> this is why `` honor among thieves '' works as an oxymoron , honor is by essence deprived from anything or egotistical , therefore even the most meticulously set-up and ingenuously constructed plan , is meant to fail sooner or later , a criminal ca n't get over his true nature , which implies the lack of honor . <sssss> take all the classic dramatic heist movies -lrb- i wo n't list them to avoid spoilers -rrb- , they all fail , it 's not a golden rule , but otherwise , it would contradict the very essence of crime -lrb- getting money for noble cause is hardly what motivates gangsters and thieves when they steal jewels -rrb- . <sssss> now , how can this doom be such an obligatory element without providing a sense of predictability ? <sssss> simply because it 's never about heists , it 's all about characters , melville knew that , kubrick did and before them , huston . <sssss> the element of failure is the only redeeming quality a criminal can afford , without it , there could n't become sympathetic antiheroes . <sssss> a gangster can only inspire by the way he tries to rise himself above his condition with morality and principles , only be betrayed by less ethical persons , villains within villain plot-wise . <sssss> the big sister of failure is a notion always cherished by the film-noir genre : fatality . <sssss> so , it 's not surprising that the greatest caper films belong to the noir genre and that `` the asphalt jungle '' is a landmark since there is no heist film that you ca n't connect with it . <sssss> it 's not surprising either that it 's precisely john huston who introduced all the formulas of the , since most of his films dealt directly or indirectly with failures and losers : `` the maltese falcon '' , `` the treasure of the sierra madre '' , `` the misfits '' , `` the night of the iguana '' ... huston had a unique ability to provide an extraordinarily tragic dimension to low-life characters . <sssss> emmerich 's quote foreshadows a treachery , even more saddening , because it 's caused by the greed of one person , and worsened when the intermediary , cobby , the weakling bookie played by mark lawrence , rats about the heist . <sssss> still , and this is what transcends `` the asphalt jungle '' into a gripping masterpiece of realism , is that it never falls in the trap of , huston 's writing and directing provides to each character a human touch inviting us to feel some sympathy . <sssss> emmerich is the most heart breaking because he only betrays the team by necessity not by personal greed , what 's more ; encouraged by a unscrupulous detective played by brad dexter . <sssss> emmerich is broke after having wasted money by loaning money and make a sweet kid played by marilyn monroe - in one of her first roles , as the doll face who 'd call hum ` uncle lon ' - feel like a man , who still ` had it ' , whatever it was . <sssss> her unforgettable alibi could n't fool the cops . <sssss> unable to get his money back , and to match his reputation , he was doom . <sssss> they all were . <sssss> in this film so rich of distinct personalities , the one who managed to get himself an oscar nomination , the great character actor sam jaffe as erwin ` doc ' riedenschneider , dreamed of mexico , a paradise of sun and pretty girls , a benign and comprehensible appetite that would cause his demise . <sssss> he who was the mastermind , anticipating emmerich 's double-cross and every single detail , let a small weakness cause his demise . <sssss> starting from his very choice of intermediary , cobby as the one whose lack of honor made him put the deathblow when threatened by a corrupt officer , he resigned himself to give all the names : louis ciavelli , the safe-cracker -lrb- anthony caruso -rrb- , gus , the hunchbacked getaway driver -lrb- james whitmore in a remarkable performance -rrb- , ` doc ' , and the pillar of the film : sterling hayden as dix handley . <sssss> sterling hayden , with his gravelly voice and sensual , embodies all the torment that can ravage the heart of a hooligan , the in a good heart . <sssss> heart is important because it commands love and empathy , therefore principles and honor , elements that lacked in cobby , the snitch , who did n't even have enough love to his own self-esteem to shut his mouth . <sssss> and the tragedy of men like gus , dix , louis and doc is that they were no less criminal than cobby , emmerich or his detective , but they somewhat conveyed the idea of ` honor among thieves ' , that a man should respect his word , and their doom is that we were ahead of them , anticipating the human factor . <sssss> naturally , beyond these existential undertones , the film features a long heist sequence , with no score , no special effects , and an almost documentary-like value that probably remind of melville 's `` cercle rouge '' , but these ten minutes still foreshadowed the tragedy . <sssss> after all the precautions taken to avoid the alarm , the explosion caused by the soup -lrb- -rrb- activated other alarms , and cause the intervention of a cop who wounded ciavelli in an almost tragicomic way . <sssss> `` the asphalt jungle '' is about a failure to come , and john huston transcends the failure by making a film not about a heist , but about characters . <sssss> dix wanted the money to buy back the farm of horses lost by his family during the depression in kentucky , that 's what meant to him the most ... he 'll end up surrounded by horses -lrb- a scene mirrored in another melville 's masterpiece `` le doulos '' -rrb- , dead while he could have escaped the police with enough money to live with his girl -lrb- jean hagen -rrb- . <sssss> that 's not bad luck , but simply the ironic expression of fatality , the stuff the greatest caper and noir films are made of ... 
ur4234119/		\tt0169547		10		`` american beauty '' is a challenging film to review . <sssss> so challenging i hesitate between two radical attitudes , introspective and philosophical or cynical and detached , but i guess neither would work . <sssss> one would be like lester 's infamous `` highlight of the day '' , the other like lester angela 's blouse with appetite before she reveals it 's her first time . <sssss> in both cases , it 's excitement leading to disappointment . <sssss> so , what 's `` american beauty '' exactly telling us ? <sssss> in fact , i do n't even think the movie tells ` us ' something , but rather tells something different ` for each of us ' ... for some people , it 's like an `` existentialism for dummies '' film , for others , it 's an inspirational invitation to `` play an active role '' in life rather than `` enduring it '' . <sssss> the figure of kevin spacey as lester burnham , the average looking tertiary employee man , incarnates the pervert effects of suburban life , mostly made of superficiality and illusions of happiness through the sensations of owning stuff , or being someone on the basis that you wears a tie , carry a briefcase and have a job , no matter how useless for the future of humanity , it is . <sssss> but lester incarnates this figure with the quality that makes losers so appealing : lucidity . <sssss> he knows his life is crap . <sssss> he knows his wife carolyn -lrb- annette bening -rrb- and his tormented 17-year old daughter jane -lrb- thora birch -rrb- see him as a loser . <sssss> and he knows his life has reached rock-bottom , but it 's never too late to change . <sssss> paraphrasing another existential film of the same year , we meet lester `` at a very strange time in his life '' , where in a crucial howard ` ' impulse , he decides he ca n't take it anymore . <sssss> and the pivotal point could n't have been creepier . <sssss> lester gets infatuated with his daughter 's friend , the cute and apparently slutty angela , and decides to do some muscular exercises , to impress her and ultimately to ... sort of ... bang her . <sssss> well , the beautiful conrad l. hall 's cinematography depicts lester 's lusty fantasies in such stylish aesthetics you totally forget that it 's all about assessing his manhood on a creature so young , she would see the man , not the exploited office worker , the passive husband , or the lousy father . <sssss> angela , the delicate and sensual mena suvari shows the light to lester , a road paved with so many rose petals that paint lester 's dreams in a shining red almost foreseeing the film 's bloody epilogue . <sssss> anyway , from this lust at first sight moment , lester is another man , abandoning himself to solitary pleasures not in the shower anymore , but in bed with carolyn , who starts to realize that if she 's not the mother of the year , she 's not the wife either . <sssss> carolyn is a flamboyant real estate agent who loves her job , as much as her little rose garden . <sssss> she takes care of both with the same perfectionist delicacy and same dreams of accomplishment . <sssss> she 's so blinded by her ambition that she 's incapable to realize the failure of her marriage and lives more confidently in the apparent illusion of comfort and success , than the real substantial essence of happiness . <sssss> but carolyn is only superficial if you look at her with superficial eyes . <sssss> look closer , since this is the movie 's tag-line , carolyn is not ambitious , she 's not superficial , she 's just naive for god 's sake . <sssss> she 's the perfect embodiment of the constant optimistic attitude illustrated by voltaire 's character candide whose motto - ironically - happened to be : `` we need to cultivate our garden '' . <sssss> and for the disillusioned jane , the idea of self-improvement can only be reduced to a project of breasts augmentation surgery . <sssss> her teenage crisis is aggravated by the absence of strong models . <sssss> she hates her pervert father , her dull mother , her life . <sssss> the changes occurring in the burnham family will coincide with the arrival of the new neighbors , the fits , another peculiar and not-so-happy family . <sssss> the father frank , chris cooper , is a bigot minded homophobic ex-military officer , with a totally lobotomized wife and one unique son , wes bentley as the tortured ricky . <sssss> ricky is literally , the ` eye ' of the film , as the one who films people with a cam and develops a strange ability to see inner beauty whether it 's in jane , dead birds or plastic bags , yes he 's weird . <sssss> `` me ricky , you jane '' . <sssss> he 's not just an eye-opener , he 's eye-opening , lester 's evolution , leading to one of the most inspiring ' i quit ' scenes from a man who 's got ` nothing to lose ' . <sssss> but in a pessimistic device , paraphrasing another existential film of the same year , self-improvement ends up looking like masturbation and for lester , the death it lead to , was n't the `` little '' one . <sssss> he 'll end up killed by frank fits after the unfortunate misunderstanding built up all through the film . <sssss> ebert said something like : `` lester burnham is dead but he 's not a loser anymore . '' <sssss> i disagree with this attitude . <sssss> death is still the ultimate loss and i 'd rather not be a loser , only if i had the chance to be something else . <sssss> so for realistic people , `` american beauty '' is a pessimistic pamphlet against the american way of life . <sssss> for pessimistic people , it 's a depressing introspection into the alienating effect of the bourgeois way of life , for depressed people , it 's the unbearable crappyness of life ... so crappy that you rather find beauty in a vulgar plastic bag floating in the wind ... or maybe `` everything is not what it seems to be '' , and american beauty is just a manipulative film trying to convey the dangerous idea that the best way to be freed from social obligations is to do sports , smoke pot , and live like a parasite , or it 's simply the best film of the 90 's . <sssss> in other words , either `` american beauty '' is a masterpiece because it 's so misunderstood , or it 's such a masterpiece that it 's misunderstood . <sssss> that 's what i call the ` fight club ' syndrome . 
ur4234119/		\tt0116695		8		is `` jerry maguire '' a heart-warming romantic comedy with sports as a subplot ? <sssss> or a sports drama with romantic undertones ? <sssss> or is it a fascinating character study introspecting the professional and private life of a sports pro manager , and the way these two poles of his personality influence and affect each other ? <sssss> i like the third option , especially since the title says it all ; it 's a film about a man named jerry maguire . <sssss> so , who 's jerry maguire ? <sssss> at first , he strikes as the kind of character tailor-made for tom cruise ; maguire is the guy who 's successful both in business and privacy . <sssss> in fact , the two worlds interact so intensively that you ca n't quite differentiate between his friends , his colleagues and his clients , even his fiancé , avery -lrb- kelly preston -rrb- is an . <sssss> tom cruise is the ultimate yuppie and he plays the part perfectly with this extraordinary capability to make himself unlikable enough so you can better perceive his redemption , the same way he did in `` rain man '' . <sssss> but `` jerry maguire '' , as if cameron crowe , the director , was already aware of its viewers ' expectations , is pleasantly surprising because the redemption comes right at the beginning . <sssss> after a series of eye-opening incidents , one night , jerry wakes up and has a sort of breakthrough illumination ; he realizes that he wasted his life , by cumulating a generous quantity of clients -lrb- professional athletes -rrb- without taking time to understand them , to deal with them in a decent way . <sssss> struck by this rebirth of humanity , he writes an inspirational memo titled `` things we think but do not say '' . <sssss> the memo elevates him into a sports management guru status except that he 's the only one who seems to believe in his new humanistic theories ... him , and a young accountant , dorothy boyd -lrb- renee zelwegger -rrb- who ` saw the light ' through maguire 's inspirational words . <sssss> and naturally , when maguire is forced to leave the company , she 's the only one who chooses to follow him , she 's the kind of women who stand for her beliefs . <sssss> then , jerry and dorothy work together with the only client who stays , rod tidwell , a football player , smaller than average , flamboyant , truculent ... maybe a little too much , and he 's played by a scene-stealing -lrb- and oscar-winning -rrb- cuba gooding jr. . <sssss> and it 's funny how gooding seems to embody the trademarks of tom cruise 's archetypal characters through his cockiness and exuberance , but that 's part of his ` character ' , i mean within the movie . <sssss> tidwell believes he 's a great man , and naturally behind him , there 's a woman , his wife marcee -lrb- regina king -rrb- who keeps a vigilant eye on his career 's evolution . <sssss> she does n't trust maguire but she gives it a shot . <sssss> tidwell trusts him and stays out of loyalty . <sssss> and boyd genuinely loves him because she knows there 's something good inside that man . <sssss> maguire is a good guy because good people believe in him , and it works the other way , too . <sssss> indeed , the ` friends ' in the beginning , the pedant bob sugar -lrb- jay mohr -rrb- and avery , not to mention the cocky football player named cush -lrb- whom i just discovered , was the chubby vern from `` stand by me '' -rrb- , they all represent the dark side of maguire 's world , and it 's only when he gets fired , when he leaves avery and is betrayed by cush ' father who ends up signing with sugar -lrb- leaving tidwell as maguire 's only option -rrb- , it 's only when he 's an outsider from that cynical world , that we start rooting for him . <sssss> and cruise is perfect because it 's crucial that maguire starts being unlikable enough so we can give him the benefit of the doubt and then supposedly change but not enough to make us lower our guard . <sssss> the suspicion must remain whether he 's a good or a bad guy , if he 's going to make it because he believes in his ideas of if he 's going to sell his soul back to the devil . <sssss> it 's a two - way process , rod considers him a friend , not his wife . <sssss> dorothy loves him and so does her adorable little kid , ray , but her sister -lrb- bonnie hunt -rrb- is perplexed . <sssss> well , we expect a happy ending , but it 's all in the `` how '' and `` when '' it will happen . <sssss> the film deals with human relationships with a powerful mix of cleverness suitable for a comedy drama and touching tenderness , incarnated by the beautiful renee zelwegger , in a breakthrough performance that should have earned her an oscar nomination . <sssss> she 's so adorable , so unbelievably sweet , that she puts something new and unusual in romantic comedies : genuine , shameless , passionate and innocent love . <sssss> there is something quite gutsy in the way cameron crowe 's film tries to cover sports , character study , romance in one story , but the multi-layered format works because jerry maguire remains the center of gravity . <sssss> dorothy boyd is a great character because she awakens the best out of jerry and saves him from his own megalomania . <sssss> ironically , jerry does the same with rod , also blinded by his own ego too and obsession with money . <sssss> the way the two stories interact transcends a lot of predictable elements , and even when it does n't avoid some archetypal situations , the acting makes everything believable . <sssss> we know that maguire will get back to dorothy , but the way it 's handled never feels forced and insincere . <sssss> jerry listens to rod who 's got the greatest day of his career , and he 's simply talking to his wife . <sssss> jerry knows he can be a great man , but only if behind him , there 's a woman , not any woman : a ` great ' woman . <sssss> the film is notorious for having introduced many iconic lines in cinema 's dictionary : `` show me the money '' , `` you complete me '' and last but not least `` you had me at ` hello ' '' , a line that owes more to its awkwardness than romantic appeal . <sssss> interestingly , the romantic catchphrase was used in the american film institute 's 100 passions montage right after nicholson 's `` you make me want to be a better man '' . <sssss> and after watching `` jerry maguire '' , i understood this is exactly why dorothy boyd was a great woman . 
ur4234119/		\tt0107507		8		after 20 years of marriage , and with one son in college , larry -lrb- woody allen -rrb- and carol lipton -lrb- diane keaton -rrb- try to accommodate with each other 's interests , and from the very first hilarious exchanges , we get the point on how dramatically opposed they happen to be . <sssss> to give you an idea , larry loves watching ice hockey games while carol prefers to listen to wagner ; she loves manhattan 's nightlife while he 'd rather watch the midnight movie in bed . <sssss> the differences between carol and larry get more obvious when they meet mr. and mrs. house -lrb- jerry adler and lynn cohen -rrb- , an old couple living in the same floor . <sssss> in a remarkably dialog-driven sequence , we feel carol 's enthusiasm to have an for socializing and larry 's impatience to live and stop enduring mr. house 's collection of stamps . <sssss> at the end , we 're not that surprised by the following discussion about the path their life is taking , their mutual attraction and all that marital existentialism . <sssss> they have a dinner with friends in the following scene which feels like a reminiscence of `` manhattan '' , which is not surprising since the setting is one of the film 's three titular 'm ' . <sssss> we learn that carol wants to open a restaurant , larry believes it 's a foolish decision to take so late in life , yet one of their recently divorced friends ted -lrb- alan alda -rrb- encourages her . <sssss> we get it ; larry enjoys his life 's pacific serenity while carol desperately looks for a new meaning before it 's too late . <sssss> many couples face that situation where the ambitions and goals in life suddenly differ , but allen handles this material with a less polemical tone than the previous `` husbands and wives '' as if he was tired of hostile arguments . <sssss> he leaves more room for ted , whose adventurous temperament fits carol 's thirst for newness , not without feeling jealous about that . <sssss> it 's a pivotal , even crucial moment in carol and harry 's marital life . <sssss> yet the title does n't lie on the film 's premise : it 's a mysterious crime that will shatter their boring routine . <sssss> speaking of the mystery , if the previous scene where they meet the friendly houses ' couple reminded me of `` rosemary 's baby '' when mia farrow and john cassavetes met the , i was even more struck by the plot 's similarities when after a night out , carol and larry discovers that mrs. house died of a heart attack . <sssss> much more , mr. house looked unusually cheerful and not too much distraught by the loss of the woman he spent 28 years and planned to be buried with in a , raising carol 's suspicion . <sssss> `` she had a heart condition , '' he says , carol insists that mrs. house never mentioned that . <sssss> at that point , we know what she 's about , she smells something fishy and whether she 's right or wrong matters less than that she finally found an opportunity to live some thrills . <sssss> and the difference of attitudes between carol and larry is the film 's comedic basis . <sssss> indeed , the conflict between carol who wants to go further and larry who wants her to stop , will originate one of woody allen 's funniest lines : `` is that what you do when i 'm forbidding ? <sssss> i 'm not going to forbid you a lot , if you do '' . <sssss> the greatest delight of `` manhattan murder mystery '' relies on the way its intricate plot contributes to enrich the human relationships involved in the resolution and vice versa . <sssss> carol 's amateurish investigation , her growing complicity with ted , and larry 's clumsy attempts to help her after he understands that his marriage is in peril , are magnificently portrayed . <sssss> and all these interactions culminate with the help of marcia fox , played by a scene-stealing angelica huston , a dark and sensual authoress and professional poker-player , so intuitive that she 'll even steal carol 's thunder in the crime - solving process , and fascinate both ted and larry . <sssss> as a counterpart to carol 's personality , like ted for larry , marcia fox will also teach carol a few things about the word ` jealousy ' . <sssss> after , `` husbands and wives '' , a powerful social commentary about marital relationships and an opportunity for woody allen to exorcise all the demons resulting from the custody battle with mia farrow , `` manhattan murder mystery '' feels like a moment of pure refreshment . <sssss> if it 's not the best of woody allen 's rich filmography , not nominated for a best original screenplay or best supporting acting oscar -lrb- while it deserved some accolades -rrb- it 's still extremely enjoyable and delivers what we 'd expect from woody allen . <sssss> and the main pillar of this enjoyment is definitely diane keaton 's comeback and her incredible chemistry with woody allen . <sssss> indeed , i have much admiration to mia farrow , and she 'll be forever associated with some of allen 's greatest achievements , but there has always been a sort of inner sweetness in farrow that confined to poignancy and even sometimes to pathos , and this characteristic reaches a paroxysm in `` husbands and wives '' where not only her character , but the actress herself looked both unhappy , embodying the marital conflict that was poisoning their lives . <sssss> woody allen said `` mia likes to do funny things , but she 's not as broad a comedian as diane is '' , although i do n't approve the manner but i have to agree with the director , mia farrow is fine but as far as comedy is concerned , diane keaton has that little sparkle that makes all the difference . <sssss> yes , we have the new york middle-class lifestyle , the intellectual discussions with the couples of friends , allen 's neurotic personality -lrb- `` a dead body and claustrophobia , a neurotic 's jackpot '' -rrb- , his distaste for wagner , a compositor who gives him the `` urge to invade poland '' and the whole romantic twists and commentaries on men and women 's relationships , all the ingredients for a great allen 's film are here but diane keaton is the icing on the cake . <sssss> and believe me , she 's for more than three quarters in what make `` manhattan murder mystery '' such a delicious pastry , reminding us how a great chemistry she always had with woody allen , hell , even when they argue , they 're hilarious . 
ur4234119/		\tt0053125		9		for many years , i regarded `` north by northwest '' as a chaotic assemblage of action-thriller vignettes for the sake of an unsubstantial plot , using the casting of an aging cary grant as a sorry excuse to grab more fans , definitely not worthy of its reputation . <sssss> after a second viewing , i concede i did n't have the right mindset to appreciate the hidden brilliance of `` north by northwest '' . <sssss> let 's start with the plot : roger thornhill -lrb- cary grant -rrb- is an advertising executive , mistakenly taken for george kaplan , a secret agent , in reality , only a decoy to distract the villainous mastermind vandamm -lrb- james mason -rrb- from the real agent who happens to be his mistress eve kendall -lrb- eva marie saint -rrb- . <sssss> yet for the two thirds of the film , neither grant nor the viewers are aware of these subtleties . <sssss> for all we know , grant is the `` wrong man '' whose attempts to prove his innocence worsens his case even more , from driving a car over a cliff after being severely imbibed and pulling a knife out of the back of a un diplomat who 's just dropped in his arms , thornhill is the constant victim of the most unfortunate circumstances . <sssss> alfred hitchcock directs the film as if understanding the plot was not a priority , he knows the mystery effectively conveys the nightmarish karma of thornhill , the pawn of a game with unknown rules . <sssss> for all we know , it 's the cold war and he 's torn between two kind of secret agents , the good and the bad ones , hitchcock does n't embarrass himself with more details and uses the actors like living props to put in the most extreme and spectacular situations . <sssss> when thornhill confronts vandamm , he pretends not to be ` george kaplan ' , to which vandamm , with mason 's deep and voice , answers `` games ? <sssss> must we ? '' <sssss> . <sssss> thornhill is victim of the syndrome , using the same rhetoric than a guilty one , inevitably preventing vandamm to say more . <sssss> thornhill ca n't talk because he does n't know , vandamm ca n't because he does n't believe thornhill , at the end , it 's only hitch effectively keeping his little secret . <sssss> but this secrecy is not gratuitous either , it effectively induces the paranoid feeling of the story , tapping on one of fear 's most effective forms : the fear of the unknown , reaching its thrilling paroxysm in a scene set in the middle of a nowhere . <sssss> for eight minutes , nothing happens , thornhill is just waiting , for whom , for what ? <sssss> we do n't know , and we wait . <sssss> the suspense is carried by our own interrogations , until a crop-duster comes from nowhere , not with the friendliest intentions , contributing to the most defining moment of the film . <sssss> the nightmare goes on and gets so intense that thornhill would rather get himself arrested by the police . <sssss> he does n't know what he 's escaping from , but he knows enough about his enemies . <sssss> yet the unknown can also come in the form of a beautiful creature like eve kendall -lrb- eva maria saint -rrb- popping out in the middle of the chase and hiding thornhill , in her bedroom after a dinner with enough sexual innuendo to make good old grant lower his guard . <sssss> but if one ca n't face the unknown , he can leave it nonetheless . <sssss> and ironically , thornhill is given a chance to leave until he 's told by one of the ` good ' agents , played by leo g. carroll , that he endangered eve 's life . <sssss> thornhill finally detaches from his passive status by becoming a player and making his own rules . <sssss> the key is not to ` find the truth ' , at that point , we know everything , but the point is to stop being hitch 's puppet and finally act like a hero , for a last thrilling confrontation ... and to get the girl in the process . <sssss> no room for subtlety , this is not `` vertigo '' or `` rear window '' , this is pure hormonal hitchcock . <sssss> and cary grant is never more at ease and charismatic as during the last sequence , accomplishing the only act that could conceal the paranoia he endured for days , he does n't escape from the enemy , he goes to it , his direction changed and so did hithcock 's . <sssss> in a nutshell , i would say `` north by northwest '' is like the tale of an amnesic james bond . <sssss> and anticipated all the ingredients that would build the secret agent 's legend : the henchmen with killing methods as sophisticated and elaborate as they 're ineffective , escapist settings , car chases , a suave and distinguished villain , a sensual lady and naturally the ultimate climax in mt. rushmore , the very sequence that catalyzed hitchcock 's desire to make the film . <sssss> ernest lehman , who wrote the screenplay , intended to make the `` hitchcock picture that would end all the hitchcock pictures . '' <sssss> -lrb- and unintentionally pave the way for james bonds ' flicks -rrb- `` north by northwest '' reassembles every hitchcockian ingredient : the blond , the mistaken identity , the villain , the paranoia induced by the enemy 's invisibility , the claustrophobia , even martin landau as leonard is not your typical one-dimensional hit-man and has a sort of `` rope '' vibe behind his sensual eyes . <sssss> and the film magnificently concludes with one of the riskiest and most memorable ellipses of cinema 's history , the transition from trying to pull eve from the mt. rushmore to the upper bunk of a train was classic enough , the icing on the cake concocted by hitch himself was the penultimate shot of the train speeding up to the tunnel , whose symbolism needs no explanations . <sssss> `` north by northwest '' is undoubtedly the consummate hitchcock movie , even more appreciated when we 're familiar with his previous films . <sssss> for the mark of a great director is to toy with his own trademarks and indulge himself to movies with less substance but never at the expenses of suspense and entertainment , magnificently conveyed by bernard herrman 's theme and unforgettable opening credits . <sssss> `` north by northwest '' did n't end all hitchcock pictures but the great streak of the 50 's through a triumph of spectacular entertainment , explaining why , one year after , hitch would turn to a less ambitious format , almost b-movie like , in black-and-white , for an obscure little film called `` psycho '' . 
ur4234119/		\tt0063462		9		on that question , one of the most notorious politically incorrect french comedians , pierre provided the most overused answer : `` yes , but not with everybody . '' <sssss> in other words , the most racist joke has to make a non-racist person laugh without creating a bond with a racist one . <sssss> see ? <sssss> the distance between the content of his joke and its author must be evident . <sssss> a bit oppressive is n't it ? <sssss> or maybe we ca n't all agree that humor essentially depends on the intelligence of the listener . <sssss> with all its racism , sexism and inner vulgarity , the intelligence of `` the producers '' is that it works on a self-reflexive way as each joke might get the two sorts of reaction that the infamous `` springtime for hitler '' inspired on the stage audience : a slack-jawed shock or cheerful applauds . <sssss> but that 's what the `` not with anyone '' means in my opinion , you trust the intelligence of the viewer enough to believe he can see behind the laughs where your opinions lies , and that making fun of something is also part of a subtle exercise of self-derision . <sssss> was it really necessary to show max bialystock -lrb- zero mostel -rrb- and leo bloom -lrb- gene wilder -rrb- removing the nazi armband , putting it in the trashcan and spitting on it . <sssss> maybe as a reminder of the nazi 's barbarity but i thought that bit sinned by underestimating our capability to read between the lines . <sssss> anyway , apart from that moment , `` the producers '' remains one of the funniest films ever made carried by the incredible mostel and wilder duo , `` the producers '' outshines whatever defined humor in the sappy 60 's : it 's outrageous , irreverent , naughty and so blatantly amoral that calling it ` politically incorrect ' is the understatement of the century . <sssss> `` the producers '' pulverizes all the barriers of good taste with a that flirts with genius in its incredible mix between a chaotic hysteria and a perfect comical timing . <sssss> the scene where leo bloom frenetically screams `` i 'm hysterical '' before max throws water on him and then shouts `` i 'm hysterical and i 'm wet ! '' <sssss> , the whole scene punctuated with so many unintelligible noises is some of the funniest pieces of comical acting ever made and maybe a landmark in comedy . <sssss> when the water comes out of the fountain after leo bloom decides to have `` everything that 's in the movies '' feels like exultation , an orgasmic liberation from every principle ruled by the movies through a hilarious hymn for selfishness and greed . <sssss> the selfish and greedy one is max , influenced by his new accountant and future accomplice , he decides to raise money to produce a flop in order to make the greatest benefit . <sssss> the most likely play to flop , is a musical comedy about hitler , a `` love-letter to hitler '' written by a manic nazi nostalgic wonderfully played by kenneth mars . <sssss> and to be sure the play will fail ; they take the worst director of all the showbiz , roger de bris , played by christopher hewett . <sssss> it 's a real delight to see otto from `` malcolm in the middle '' and `` mr. belvedere '' in such hilarious performances , `` the producers '' is served by a wonderful gallery of supporting performances where everyone has a moment to shine , even ulla , the sexy swedish receptionist whose name rhymed with . <sssss> asking how they got away with calling a woman a ` toy ' is pointless because the real question is how they got away with the infamous `` springtime for hitler '' and this swastika choreography that concludes it with hitler 's picture ? <sssss> well , i feel that there are two reasons : right and wrong . <sssss> right first : by ridiculing even the most atrocious aspect of human history , you stop turning it into a sort of sanctified taboo . <sssss> humor becomes the true barometer of freedom of speech and if we can make fun of god , politics and sex , why should there be barriers even in the ` dark side ' . <sssss> as mel brooks said , the ` movie rose below vulgarity ' it 's so deliberately crude and vulgar that it never cease to mix the amazement with the enjoyment . <sssss> the spirit of mel brooks is what differentiates mean-spirited propaganda and true slapstick , to the donald duck fans , between `` commando duck '' a bad cartoon with no other purpose than mocking the japanese culture and the masterpiece `` der 's face '' . <sssss> now , what was the bad reason that spared an accusation of bad taste : because only jewish people could have made fun of nazis and even of jewish people with such audacity , without being accused of anti-semitism . <sssss> after all , the portrayal of max 's greed exploits some stereotypes that even the nazis used in their propaganda , if you do n't take them into perspective . <sssss> many would discuss this argument but did n't sacha boren cohen invoke his own ethnic background to justify the anti-semitism displayed in `` borat '' as a running joke . <sssss> while i understand that never a gentle director would have dared to make such a movie , i totally disapprove the setting of racial barriers in humor , with its tacit rule to make fun only of our own ethnic background . <sssss> it comedy and set rules when the very purpose of humor is to be deprived from anything except the capability to make people laugh . <sssss> there 's no way to avoid critics because the line between being offensive and funny will always be uncertain , but that 's the subversion of humor . <sssss> many comedians were labeled as racist when they mocked some communities , as if the translation of `` yes , but not with anyone '' became `` not by anyone '' which distorts the very principles of humor . <sssss> `` can we laugh about everything ? '' <sssss> i guess the answer is in the question , if we laugh , then it 's funny . <sssss> if we 're intelligent enough to get it , then we can make a difference between insults and jokes , between mockery and mean-spiritedness , and those who ca n't , i recommend `` the producers '' as the greatest fertilizer to grow a sense of humor in the field of their constipated minds . 
ur4234119/		\tt0241303		8		is it ? <sssss> in fact , more than the film 's characterizing food , lasse hallström 's `` chocolat '' symbolizes these little pleasures and delights that , once you taste them , make you inevitably wonder if it 's worth troubling over the mightier matters of life especially when it 's governed by the rigid hand of morality , when succumbing to the temptation or luring people into it , become a difficult , even perilous , mission . <sssss> `` chocolat '' is set in a french village with an unmemorable name , one of these ` once upon a time ' old-fashioned little places , whose people live according to tacit rules and codes that remained unperturbed for centuries . <sssss> it 's a village à la frank capra with a mayor , a priest , a grouchy lady , an old mourning widow , a lonely man walking across the street with his dog , a mad woman who hides a concealed wound in her heart , and so one and so forth . <sssss> and the village 's austere and apparently sinister stagnancy only calls for a stranger to break the morbid routine . <sssss> her name is vianne rocher , and the village , naturally , will never be the same after her arrival . <sssss> i wonder how the producers were convinced to make a film that exploits so many of the usual archetypes that nourished our classic knowledge , in a world that got so eagerly sucked into the progresses of technology , action and fast-paced thrillers . <sssss> indeed , when fairytale and sentimentality mostly belong to animation , `` chocolat '' 's presence feels as awkward as vianne 's in the village . <sssss> they probably thought that it 's today 's very audience that would need that kind of nostalgic escapism or that the film would never fail to touch the hearts , because the heroine is portrayed by juliette binoche . <sssss> and yes , as vianne rocher , binoche is the secret ingredient that gives the film its delicious flavor . <sssss> only binoche could carry the perfect mixture of alluring tenderness and enigmatic confidence , she 's not just the typical ` cute shop owner ' , she 's the embodiment of that sly wind blowing from the north , like a fresh air about to dust off the village 's preconceived ideas , and undermine the dominance of mayor comte de reynaud , played by alfred molina . <sssss> his antagonism with vianne starts with her inconvenient timing ; she opens a chocolate shop during the lent , much more at sunday hours . <sssss> his invitation -lrb- more like a polite coercion -rrb- to join the church forces her to reveal that she 's not religious , not married , which makes the existence of her seven-year-old daughter anouk -lrb- victoire thivisol -rrb- even more accusing . <sssss> and with her unusual lifestyle , fittingly red clothing and seemingly defiant attitude toward religion -lrb- despite its optimistic and good-hearted facade -rrb- , vianne does n't get the warmest welcome from the townspeople . <sssss> yet she 's ready to win each heart , one by one , all it will take is one taste from each one 's favorite chocolate -lrb- which she mysteriously guesses -rrb- to reignite a marital flame , or even draw a smile in the face of armande , her opinionated landlady , played by judi dench , the second perfect casting of the film . <sssss> armande 's bitterness is the sad result of a conflict with her overprotective daughter caroline -lrb- carrie ann-moss -rrb- who 's forbidden her son luc to visit his ` ' grandmother '' . <sssss> the chocolate shop soon becomes the refuge for armande and luc to meet each other and develop a secret bond . <sssss> the other subplots involve josephine -lrb- lena olin -rrb- who 's brutalized by serge , her drunken husband , the bartender played by peter stormare , and as expected , her growing friendship with vianne gives her enough confidence to stand against serge during a violent assault , when she finally overpowers him with a skillet . <sssss> thankfully , this is the kind of uninspired caricature that only works because the movie does n't get any further . <sssss> the film remains faithful to its initial tone , and never falls in the temptation to depict the religious townspeople as intolerant bigots . <sssss> and even molina remains closer to a more aristocratic version of hercule poirot than any other mustached villain ; he 's a man whose prejudices are rooted in marital troubles that led him to vent his anger on a free-spirited female like vianne . <sssss> but the film intelligently avoids the reverse that would have placed religion or men as the obligatory scapegoats . <sssss> `` chocolat '' is all about allowing one 's spirit to elevate beyond the limits dictated by a book , and find one 's own truth within the inner beauty of what life , or god for that matter , has to offer . <sssss> little anouk has an imaginary friend named pantoufle , a kangaroo with an injured leg , but it 's just an innocent touch to highlight that she 's inherited her mother 's mysterious sparkle . <sssss> a romance also blooms with the arrival of a group of gypsies , drafting along the river , among them the handsome guitar player named roux -lrb- johnny depp -rrb- . <sssss> depp 's chemistry with binoche never feels like a plot device : we do believe a woman who was so badly received would embrace newcomers with a more generous heart . <sssss> at the end , all the characters ' arcs close in an emotionally satisfying way , not always unpredictable , but it does n't really affect the enjoyment . <sssss> of course , it 's tempting to judge `` chocolat '' with more cynical eyes , but how about imagining how respectful to the audience 's sensitivity , the film remains ? <sssss> how one-dimensionally feminist it would have been if other women were victims of men 's abuses , how simplistically sentimental if a mother-and-daughter argument between armande and caroline had broken , while a simple look was enough to show that the two women finally made peace . <sssss> and finally , how dreadfully caricatured if an angry mob came to burn the chocolate shop ... well , i 'm grateful to the story for not having taken this path and yet kept the overall simplicity of its plot without depicting the villagers as a one-dimensional bunch , in a way or another . <sssss> the film 's spirit is magnificently conveyed by a catchy guitar tune , transporting us in a universe where benign and innocent temptations , open the pandora box where we can find the key to our own happiness . <sssss> too poetic ? <sssss> well , that 's another adjective that fits with `` chocolat '' . 
ur4234119/		\tt0072431		10		`` young frankenstein '' is n't just funny , it 's a masterpiece that transcends every standard of comedy with such brilliance and grace that calling it a parody or a spoof is almost insulting . <sssss> after watching `` young frankenstein '' , i discovered that it was only nominated for 2 oscars : best sound and best original screenplay -lrb- co-written with mel brooks from gene wilder 's original draft -rrb- . <sssss> had the movie been nominated for other awards , it would n't have surprised me : the photography is top notch and perfectly renders the feeling of old 30 's horror classics , the black and white cinematography perfectly conveys the haunting shadowy atmosphere of the original `` frankenstein '' , the score is perfect for the story , mel brooks ' directing never seemed so tactful and professional and i can think of any of the main cast deserving a nod for the acting . <sssss> i guess that the film being released the same year than `` chinatown '' or `` the godfather part ii '' did n't help ; mel brooks was n't the only one at the top of his game . <sssss> but let 's get back to `` young frankenstein '' . <sssss> besides being an undeniable technical achievement , the film is an excellent comedy that contains some of the most hilarious lines and moments in cinematic history and certainly the greatest comedic cast ever -lrb- thunders ' sound effects to emphasize -rrb- . <sssss> indeed , each actor , each actress occupies the screen with a unique magnetism , starting by gene wilder , the one with whom it all started . <sssss> as wilder said , he wondered how he would act if he was the descendant of the infamous baron viktor von frankenstein , the answer could n't have been more intelligent and hilarious . <sssss> the professor is so ashamed of his affiliation that he wants his name to be pronounced ` ' , but this attitude reflects an interesting contradiction as he finally realizes he ca n't escape his destiny and must go to transylvania to accomplish the same miracle than his glorious ancestor . <sssss> after a decent start , mel brooks ` elevates ' the film . <sssss> the doctor meets a wonderful gallery of colorful characters , the voluptuous assistant inga , played by teri garr , in a knock-out performance , cloris leachman as the frightening frau blücher whose any mention of her name never ceases to make the horses rear in fright , and there is 's fiancée , in a role that could have been secondary if it was n't for madeline kahn 's extraordinary scene-stealing ability . <sssss> the film also features kenneth mars barely recognizable in his policeman 's disguise , and an even less recognizable performance by gene hackman as a well-mannered blind man -lrb- i ca n't believe i missed it during the first viewing -rrb- . <sssss> but in all cinematic objectivity , the film 's greatness relies on two pillar performances , and i 'll start with the most memorable one . <sssss> first , there 's marty 's role as igor -lrb- pronounced eye-gor -rrb- as the hunchback and butler of the transylvanian mansion . <sssss> igor 's character inspired what would remain for me the greatest character 's introduction in any comedy , with this sudden and unforgettable close-up on his smile and incredibly bulged eyes . <sssss> to appreciate the comical talent of feldman requires both a voracious appetite and a gourmet 's delicacy . <sssss> his comical genius can take you totally off - guard when his face shows up from nowhere , or when he ad-libs a scene - i wo n't say which but it 's so hysterical that even gene wilder looks like he 's totally losing it - or you just have to pay attention to his mimics , his reactions when a gag is already over , and realize that igor himself , is a punchline within a punchline . <sssss> the `` what hump ? '' <sssss> moment is pure comedic gold . <sssss> the other pillar is of course peter boyle as the creature , monster is too cruel a word to even be used on this gentle giant with high-pitched screams and touching hobby of catching imaginary butterflies in the air . <sssss> boyle beautifully incarnates the syndrome of the misunderstood monster and the spirit of mary shelley 's novel . <sssss> and this epitomizes the merit and the force of `` young frankenstein '' : each actor and actresses does n't play a character , but reinvent a role with such an intensity that the film stands alone as a classic . <sssss> of course , it has all the elements of the `` frankenstein '' series , but you do n't need to be a fan to appreciate mel brooks ' film on its own . <sssss> it 's not just a masterpiece of stylish copy , it 's a masterpiece as a story , as an ambiance , as an ensemble cast performance , as a comedy where visual and written comedy works in perfect harmony -lrb- the farewell in the train station scene is a perfect demonstration -rrb- i often blamed `` blazing saddles '' for being too broad on the , and to let the movie evolve to an extreme where the humor ceased to be enjoyable story-wise and overused the whole jokes , almost insisting upon itself until a throw-away climax . <sssss> `` young frankenstein '' does n't evoke itself ; it does n't try to imitate but succeeds in duplicating an atmosphere to provide a whole other reaction from the audience . <sssss> and the adaptation is so original that it can be regarded as one of the greatest ` frankenstein ' films , any genre combined , and peter boyle 's performance has nothing to envy on boris karloff , it 's simply ... magical and it contributes to one of the highlights of the film . <sssss> indeed , if you wanted a last proof that `` young frankenstein '' is an original classic , forever rooted in cinematic memories , just start singing this : `` if you 're blue and you do n't know where to go to why do n't you go where fashion sits ... '' any movie expert would say `` puttin ' in the ritz '' referring to some fred astaire dance routine , but a true movie lover would immediately reply `` puddin ' on a '' in a high-pitched voice . <sssss> the movie features one of the most hilarious musical duets ever that would make even the most abnormal brain laugh . <sssss> and if only for that piece of hilarity , mel brooks 's masterpiece `` young frankenstein '' deserves to its place as one of the funniest films ever , it 's raunchy , outrageous , irreverent , poetic , sensitive , inventive and as would shout the creature : `` '' 
ur4234119/		\tt0405159		9		`` million dollar baby '' is undoubtedly the most acclaimed movie of 2004 . <sssss> it has often been referred by movie critics as a cinematic come-back to a more traditional film-making , like the dark and gripping hollywood underdog stories of the 30 's and 40 's , a comparison that has been made for `` rocky '' in its time . <sssss> `` million dollar baby '' is a film of a few characters that yet constitute a solid and powerful acting ensemble . <sssss> but has clint eastwood and morgan freeman ever gave a disappointing performance ? <sssss> even hillary swank who won the oscar for best actress , is totally diluted in her role as maggie fitzgerald , the white trash southern girl whose only dream in life is to become a professional boxer . <sssss> ` dream ' is too vague a word , ` reason to keep faith in this world ' is more appropriate . <sssss> and faith is a redundant theme in the story , faith as a strong belief in life 's driving forces , including ours . <sssss> it 's definitely an underdog story , but told with great respect to the viewers . <sssss> like its glorious ` underdog ' predecessor , `` rocky '' , `` million dollar baby '' restrains all the emotions until finally imploding during a poignant and heart-breaking third act . <sssss> the first ones consist on building relationships until their within the story emotionally bloom . <sssss> clint eastwood is frankie dunn , the hardened boxing trainer and morgan freeman , his assistant eddie scrap-iron dupris , an whose dead eye symbolize other unconcealed wounds in his heart . <sssss> frankie also has demons to exorcise , and the film never tries to hide them . <sssss> we understand it 's about a daughter life has taken away from him , that he tries to find some meaning about god , harassing a priest with pointless questions ... that would take all their significance at the end . <sssss> it 's also easy to see that maggie would complete frankie , that he 's going to help her as much as she will . <sssss> it takes time before he takes the crucial decision to train her , maybe too much time but this is the mark of a film that cares more about characters than action . <sssss> it 's true sometimes , we can feel some events coming , when frankie seems reluctant to engage his most valued protégé in heavyweight championship ; we know it 's a matter of time before the man leaves him . <sssss> why ? <sssss> because there has to be a gap in frankie 's heart , and relationships are all about `` filling gaps '' . <sssss> that 's what balboa said about his romance with adrian , the same goes between frankie and maggie , in a father-and-daughter way . <sssss> there is a mystery surrounding the gaelic nickname he 'll gave to her , the translation , if not surprising , is nonetheless poignant . <sssss> that 's the point , if you expect surprises , if you expect twists and new artistic licenses on the sports genre , get ready for disappointment . <sssss> `` million dollar baby '' has the one flaw of clint eastwood 's film : things are obvious and straight-forward , the bad guys are bad , the good ones are good . <sssss> the way maggie is treated by her opportunistic family , almost as villainous as the big blue bear , is eastwood 's trademark , the depiction of a world in black and white . <sssss> the film itself has a dark and shadowy atmosphere , conveying the nastiness and cruelty of a world , where the most precious moments have to keep intimate and secret . <sssss> rather than an exercise in obviousness , `` million dollar baby '' is a film that focuses on these intimate interactions , these moments where something sacred is transmitted : a secret , a declaration , a revelation ... and only eastwood and freeman can get away with their own clichés without ruining the film 's intents . <sssss> yes , we have morgan freeman and his noble voice-over narration , translating into words what sometimes images ca n't express . <sssss> yes his gravely , deliberately monotonous voice , has a hypnotizing effect in our ears . <sssss> yes , eastwood is groaning , grumpy character . <sssss> yes , the comparison with `` the shawshank redemption '' is inevitable , and it 's impossible not to laugh sometimes at eastwood 's bad moods . <sssss> but `` million dollar baby '' has to be judged in its entirety , if you feel manipulated , ask yourself about the movie 's pay-off , what does it speak to you ? <sssss> what does it say about life , about dreams ? <sssss> sentimentality is one thing , but movie-making is an art-form whose merit can only be judged on its capacity to inspire emotions . <sssss> and emotionally , the ending is satisfying . <sssss> i feel like i would spoil the film if i go further in this review . <sssss> i do n't want to reveal the events that constitute the final third act , although the film 's ranking among one of the greatest tear-jerker give enough hints not to expect a happy ending . <sssss> but again , it 's not about happiness , but about people meeting each other , and filling each other 's gaps . <sssss> it flirts with some obviousness , but to be sincere , i never felt it forced or stereotypical . <sssss> i wish i could be smart and cynical enough to dismiss the film , and label it as propaganda , manipulation and dangerous influence , but the fact is that the three performance touched my heart . <sssss> i understand the criticism , i even understand the hatred , but the film deeply moved me . <sssss> the ` obviousness ' is precisely what critics refer as renaissance of hollywood tradition . <sssss> maybe in this era where psychological thrillers and non-linear narrative are overused by new talents , a movie like `` million dollar baby '' that does n't care about subtlety and nuance yet cares to tell a gripping and powerful story about three people , maybe this is the refreshment cinema asked for . <sssss> and the fluid directing , the shadowy cinematography , the patient editing and the acting , contribute to a powerful movie , showing people evolving with time , people with dreams and hopes . <sssss> reviewing a film is a matter of genuine feelings and sincerity ; i would be lying to myself if i started to criticize it for the sake of it . <sssss> if i did , no matter how clever and hip i would sound , i would n't dare to review other movies . <sssss> in all sincerity , i loved `` million dollar baby '' and it 's indeed one of clint eastwood 's best works .

'' <sssss> . <sssss> a general and cheerful stockholm syndrome , he wins the people 's hearts and ours with one of the most legendary rally cries evoking a lost era where people had the guts to stand for their beliefs . <sssss> `` dog day afternoon '' is one of the films of the 70 's , with a rebellious mind , and a heart too ... and god , the heart of the film ... when you expect , you had all the surprises ; the best is to come when we learn why sonny robbed the bank with the entrance of leon , his ` wife ' , portrayed in a nuanced but powerful performance by chris sarandon as a woman trapped in a man 's body . <sssss> yep , the movie is full of strong supporting performances . <sssss> chris is so convincing we feel this tender love and complicity that could inspire sonny the desperate idea to rob a bank to pay for his lover 's sex change . <sssss> a complicity translated by the legendary improvised phone-call scene , which genuinely contrasts with the noisier one with sonny 's official -lrb- and talkative -rrb- wife . <sssss> these are the elements that placed sonny wortzik among the most fascinating characters of cinema 's history and made pacino a legend , with a character who could n't have been more different than the icy and cold-blooded michael corleone . <sssss> the story provides him a human touch , he 's got a life , a wife , a lover , and he lives and leaves them with such intensity we lose the control of the film . <sssss> we were laughing , now we feeling sonny 's pain as he 's dealing with this tragicomedy , his loss of control and of the people 's sympathy after his homosexuality was revealed . <sssss> al pacino 's eyes burn with an intensity crystallizing an out of control situation . <sssss> it 's dark , sweaty , we can hardly breathe , and the claustrophobic feeling transcends the bank , even the film . <sssss> the film which concludes as it started , in an abrupt , detached and cold way . <sssss> the police kills sal and sonny begs for life . <sssss> he did n't want to betray sal , but in a way , he was so alienated by the whole craziness of the situation , he lost the control and did n't even realize how nuts he 's gone , like wondering one minute before his arrest if he 'll have food in the plane , or believing he was really going to algeria . <sssss> the tragic realization that makes you wonder how this happened , and pacino 's eyes look like he 's telling himself , `` how could i have ever thought i had a chance '' ... ... sanity was back again , the show was over and the movie could conclude .

'' <sssss> `` no , he 's chasing me '' . <sssss> these ten seconds are enough justifications to the backwards narration . <sssss> and since the movie starts with the killing , basically , the reverse thing 's point is to teach us , not to believe in the appearances ... lenny 's short-term memory problem : the kind of plot device that could taste like caviar when handled by a good screenwriter and like tomato juice by another . <sssss> basically , if he just finished reading this part of the review , he ca n't remember how it started ; imagine how painful it would be . <sssss> i do n't know , if this handicap convinced chris nolan to make the story backwards of it 's the idea of making a story backwards that reminded him of memory problems , but it would be like discussing of what was first : the egg or the chicken ... the idea was perfect , and the way , we follow lenny in his backwards quest to find the murdered of his wife is a gold mine for memorable situations . <sssss> among the great memorable scenes , there 's one where you wonder why lenny 's being mocked by a drunkard while tasting a beer given by the waitress ... simply , a brilliant story . <sssss> did you notice i used a specific word : story ? <sssss> there is the script , and the story , too . <sssss> the story had to justify this architecture . <sssss> by the way , i 'm using the word architecture for the second time , because i know nolan is like an architect of screen writing , using plot devices as so many bricks to build unforgettable movies , i did n't think it worked that well for `` inception '' because it lacked something called ` heart ' , it works with `` memento '' because the story has one , and its heart pumped by a true desire of revenge . <sssss> lenny , played by a superb guy pearce , has one quest , finding john g. , the one who raped and murdered his wife . <sssss> his motives are understandable , and the story would have been a normal linear chase if it was n't for one handicap : lenny 's short-term memory problem , the kind of plot device that could taste like caviar when handled by a good screenwriter ... `` memento '' is a cinematic experience that tricks your mind from beginning to end , or should i say , from the ending to the beginning , or wait a minute , again , i 'm lost ... now , where was i ? <sssss> oh yeah , you know that they say about a good script ? <sssss> it must have a beginning , middle , and an ending ... but not necessarily in that order . <sssss> i guess `` memento '' respects the idea of what makes a good story , but the genius of the script , and the brilliance of its creativity rely on the incredible architecture that started the film at the end , to go on backwards , until an unforgettable climactic conclusion , that occurred at the beginning of the story . <sssss> simply , a brilliant story ...

ur0774754/		\tt0387131		9		there have been nifty thrillers over the years with conspiracy attached , and many of them have been good like the parallax view and jfk . <sssss> yet few of these have been able to rise above the visceral angst of suspense and intrigue to attain another level of human emotion . <sssss> one good example is the recent adaptation of john le carre 's novel , the constant gardener . <sssss> adapted by jeffrey caine and directed by fernando meirelles , this is a superior cinematic rendition of a good , moral suspense yarn told with methodical precision and emotional resonance . <sssss> tessa -lrb- rachel weisz -rrb- is a who marries timid diplomat , justin qualye -lrb- ralph fiennes -rrb- and follows him to kenya in africa . <sssss> when his wife goes missing , justin decides to follow his wife 's trail and find out what really happened and why . <sssss> the clues lead to a pharmaceutical drug corporation that is testing tuberculosis drugs on the lower class population . <sssss> what justin finds is a shocking conspiracy of secrets and lies reaching up to the british government and a corporate entity that will stop at nothing to release its money making windfall . <sssss> as justin discovers the truth , he begins to understand the ruthless nature of conspirators even as he begins to uncover the truth about his marriage . <sssss> this is a chilling mystery story that is at its heart a tale of romantic love between a man and a wife he really does n't know . <sssss> although not perfect , it does endeavor to be many things , and it integrates the love story that forms the soul of the film with an elaborate detective story that touches upon morality , fear , hope , and redemption and achieves them quite well . <sssss> it 's like reading a long , complex novel . <sssss> that a film could be filled with so many attributes is quite an achievement and a testament to the source material by le carre , a constant source of complex , filmic material ever since the breakout adaptation of his the spy who came in from the cold in the 1960 's . <sssss> it is also a tribute to director meirelles who has a sure hand in every scene and edit while never losing track of his many themes and maintaining strong performances from his talented cast . <sssss> at first justin is oblivious to the insidious forces around him . <sssss> the garden that he tends to is a metaphor of sorts to a basic , uncomplicated view of his world that is suddenly shaken . <sssss> the backgrounds in many scenes show a rural countryside with poor people struggling to survive . <sssss> life is hard for the people in a harsh landscape . <sssss> there are always incidental shots of children usually in the background as casual bystanders or observers ; they are the innocent ones . <sssss> this story and its people are distant cousins of the drug gangs in meirelles ' previous , breakthrough film , city of god . <sssss> it is in this setting that justin retraces tessa 's footsteps which lead to a dirty secret and a rediscovery of their love . <sssss> throughout it all , there is an almost inevitable , hopeless feeling , like a stacked deck against justin . <sssss> then there is the question of trust . <sssss> who to trust ? <sssss> it seems everyone is either partly involved with the bad guys or reluctant to get involved . <sssss> there are different levels of trust . <sssss> there is the hint of marital infidelity and the questioning of loyalty . <sssss> in this respect , the constant gardener reminds one of the underrated under fire . <sssss> the narrative fluidly flashes back and forth at will to show the beginnings of justin and tessa 's relationship amid the intrigue in kenya . <sssss> there 's also lots of hand-held camera work -lrb- cesar charlone -rrb- that gives the film a semi documentary feel . <sssss> while the look is raw and primitive , the editing -lrb- by oliver stone alumni claire simpson -rrb- is sophisticated and clever as various bits of associative imagery are connected to great emotional and informative effect . <sssss> a great deal of thought and planning went into this story and its adaptation to connect the dots . <sssss> fiennes is excellent as the beleaguered husband who seeks the truth about his wife . <sssss> he has a knack for playing tragic characters -lrb- quiz show , the english patient -rrb- , and he has never been better than in this role . <sssss> you feel his confusion and pain as he goes against difficult odds . <sssss> rachel weisz is terrific as the brave crusader of the african people who risks harm and her marriage by digging for the truth . <sssss> you feel her passion in tessa 's character and the free spirit that dominates every scene she is in . <sssss> you just know that tessa 's own hard-headed agenda will get her in trouble . <sssss> it is a far cry from weisz 's days in action blockbusters like the mummy , and it is her best role to date . <sssss> the rest of the uniformly strong cast is excellent particularly bill nighy as the slimy pellegrin . <sssss> if you are a conspiracy buff , then this is your kind of film . <sssss> although it is a bit of a downer , ultimately it is a haunting fable with memorable imagery , and it is a film that stays with you long after it is over . <sssss> it should stay with oscar voters for the long term as well . 
ur0774754/		\tt0964517		9		ok , you may think , `` another boxing film about a nobody who becomes somebody '' , right ? <sssss> do n't underestimate the fighter as another boxing film . <sssss> it has heart and good acting , but most of all , it is authentic . <sssss> this film purposely avoids sentiment and going for easy , weepy moments . <sssss> rocky this is not . <sssss> this pet project of producer and star mark wahlberg has been years in the making and the payoff here is a gallery of great performances by talented actors who do justice to their real life counterparts . <sssss> this true story centers on boxer micky ward -lrb- mark wahlberg -rrb- who struggles to be a junior welterweight champion with training by his half-brother and former fighter , dicky ekland -lrb- an emaciated christian bale -rrb- . <sssss> dicky lives his dashed dreams through micky and has his own problems with drug addiction and other criminal activities . <sssss> the extended family includes a supportive father and a controlling mother , alice -lrb- melissa leo -rrb- . <sssss> micky 's life changes when he meets a bartender , charlene -lrb- amy adams -rrb- , who believes in him . <sssss> when the opportunity comes to take his career to the next level and work with professional trainers and management in las vegas , micky 's relationship with dicky is jeopardized and causes a mighty rift with his family especially his ` manager ' alice who feels betrayed . <sssss> to make matters worse , dicky gets in trouble with the law and must serve prison . <sssss> he still lives in the past , clinging to memories of boxing sugar ray leonard in 1978 . <sssss> micky is so torn when a seemingly winnable fight switches his intended opponent to one who is much heavier at the last minute , that he contemplates quitting altogether . <sssss> riddled with guilt , he becomes reclusive until charlene intercedes . <sssss> he begins to fight again and amasses a series of wins until he is one step away from a championship if he can overcome a challenger , sanchez , and dicky offers tips on how to fight him . <sssss> faced with a chance to really make something of his career , micky must choose between his new handlers and dicky who taught him everything he knows about boxing . <sssss> it could mean a championship in the end . <sssss> the film works on different levels of relationships : micky and charlene , micky and his family , but most of all the film rests on the bond between the two brothers . <sssss> there is a good sense of family life and local flavor . <sssss> micky and dicky grew up local athletes and resident celebrities of sorts in a blue collar town where everybody knows each other . <sssss> when micky and charlene challenge alice , there is a tumultuous change of dynamics and a tense battle of wills . <sssss> the best scene and also a turning point in the story happens when dicky confronts charlene about her own shortcomings , and everything in a way comes full circle as each person must look within to missed opportunities and not achieving their dreams . <sssss> it is an honest , pivotal moment that validates dicky 's character who , surprisingly , still knows a thing or two about boxing . <sssss> ironically micky and dicky 's scenes recall marlon brando and rod steiger as brothers in on the waterfront also about a washed up fighter . <sssss> the fight scenes are quite convincing and well edited , and when you have a well chiseled actor like wahlberg -lrb- the departed -rrb- , a kind of modern day john garfield , you accept him as a boxer without question . <sssss> bale -lrb- the dark knight -rrb- really inhabits his portrayal of a proverbial loser , and he looks the part having shed substantial weight . <sssss> was this once the boy who enchanted us in steven spielberg 's empire of the sun ? <sssss> come to think of it , spielberg has another young alumnus in adams -lrb- catch me if you can -rrb- who makes the most of her role as a bright , headstrong woman who supports micky and butts heads with alice and her daughters literally . <sssss> leo -lrb- frozen river -rrb- is quite good as the proud matriarch whose influence and authority is threatened . <sssss> the film tells its story as directed by david o. russell -lrb- three kings -rrb- in workman like manner . <sssss> it 's almost the kind of film clint eastwood makes these days . <sssss> the story and relationships are strong enough to easily carry the film without resorting to sentimentality . <sssss> indeed , there is a thrilling moment ringside where a shot almost follows through with alice and charlene hugging , but russell cuts away to another unglamorous shot . <sssss> bravo for not taking the easy way out although there are a couple of scenes could have been extended more . <sssss> it 's also nice to see the real life brothers in the end credits , and you know that the film has done their lives justice . <sssss> the original screenplay and story had a lot of writers involved , and the result is a heck of a remarkable comeback story and a family that would not quit . 
ur0774754/		\tt0808151		7		dan brown 's phenomenal bestseller , the davinci code was made into an equally successful film adaptation . <sssss> angels and demons , while actually a prequel to that book , has been adapted into a movie sequel , and the results are certainly more promising . <sssss> director ron howard and actor tom hanks reteam for a better telling of intrigue , murder , and suspense amid a historic and religious setting . <sssss> essentially an almost real-time thriller which jumps from ancient landmark to landmark , this film actually works pretty well within its own confines and is thus a satisfying entertainment without getting sidetracked on the holy mission of revelatory discovery and truth that its predecessor got tangled in . <sssss> a scientific breakthrough in a swiss laboratory generates powerful , anti-matter particles . <sssss> when a mysterious group steals this deadly material , they threaten vatican city with annihilation . <sssss> the plot thickens when four cardinals , in consideration to succeed the recently deceased pope , are kidnapped and threatened with hourly execution at a holy site . <sssss> despite his purely scientific , empirical measure of the world , symbologist robert langdon -lrb- tom hanks with a normal hairdo this time -rrb- is whisked from harvard campus to vatican city where he is joined by dr. vittoria vetra -lrb- ayelet zurer -rrb- whose lab created the stolen particles . <sssss> together , they attempt to locate the cardinals and the anti-matter particles . <sssss> we meet the vatican police guard and their protocols and protectiveness over not only the church and its members , but its archives which are at the heart of langdon 's quest for clues . <sssss> the pope 's assistant , camerlengo patrick mckenna -lrb- ewan mcgregor -rrb- , the vatican guard commander richter -lrb- stellan skarsgard -rrb- , and elder cardinal strauss -lrb- armin mueller-stahl -rrb- participate in the investigation . <sssss> history -lrb- according to dan brown -rrb- has it that in , four scientists or known as the illuminati were kidnapped , branded and executed by the church . <sssss> now a darker version of the illuminati is ready to exact an ` eye-for-an-eye ' revenge on the church , and they intend to finish the job with one big bang of anti-matter . <sssss> the clues lead to the four elements of fire , water , air and earth , and perhaps more . <sssss> what do these have to with actual church locations ? <sssss> complicating the proceedings is a mysterious assassin who carries out the lethal agenda with unerring accuracy even as langdon , dr. vetra , and the police attempt to prevent further bloodshed . <sssss> should vatican city be evacuated as thousands of people hold a vigil for the new pope ? <sssss> can everyone be trusted even in the most sensitive and elite of holy circles ? <sssss> these questions are raised as langdon desperately searches for answers to save the vatican . <sssss> having not read the original novel , i feel the film does work on its own which is more than can be said of its predecessor which got lost in self importance and confusing exposition . <sssss> screenwriters david koepp -lrb- jurassic park , spiderman -rrb- and akiva goldsman -lrb- a beautiful mind -rrb- have tried to streamline and condense brown 's immense , detailed novel into a serviceable story , which focuses on a race against time and is a pretty decent mystery without having the ` holier than thou ' agenda . <sssss> references are made to langdon 's previous adventure with the davinci code , but the film wisely stays on course almost in so that the suspense level is ratcheted up progressively until the potentially explosive climax . <sssss> there are some shortcomings to the film . <sssss> there is a lot of material covered here so it seems a bit episodic , and plot details that beg for a more patient explanation are raced over . <sssss> the characters are not sufficiently fleshed out to give more meaning to what happens later . <sssss> all we get are some brief notes of each person 's background to go forward ; that is a missed opportunity . <sssss> perhaps dan brown 's book did not give much in the way of detailed history for his players , but that does not excuse the filmmakers from trying to make a stronger , more emotional connection . <sssss> further , elements of the plot strain credibility , and you need to make a leap of faith so to speak to accept some pretty amazing coincidences and key events . <sssss> in particular , the climax is full of major surprises and a stunning turn of events that require a suspension of disbelief . <sssss> production values are impressive particularly in the art direction and visual effects to recreate vatican city -lrb- since permission for location shooting was denied -rrb- . <sssss> the camera work shows great fluidity , and seldom have visuals been more kinetic as in this film or for that matter any other recent . <sssss> this helps in the pacing and overall flow of the story . <sssss> it 's nice for a change to see male and female leads working together without resorting to the obligatory romance . <sssss> here , it 's strictly business . <sssss> in fact the film plays almost like a chapter of tv 's 24 or the x files which may determine whether the plot twists and turns are surprising or satisfyingly fresh to the uninitiated viewer . <sssss> if you have seen the godfather iii , the storyline conspiracies may also seem a bit familiar . <sssss> still , you get the feeling that howard and hanks have gotten the hang of things this time around . <sssss> what you get is a moderately interesting mystery in an elaborate , big budget setting . <sssss> the visuals are impressive but the story itself is nothing special to write home about . 
ur7969168/		\tt0424136		6		almost all the negative comments revolve around either the story being too unbelievable or a case of hopeless dialog or acting . <sssss> furthermore there is a complaint about subtlety on the subject of pedophilia ... to address the latter : lighten up folks ; it 's a -lrb- horror -rrb- movie , not an educational promo . <sssss> i 'm not a particular fan of the horror genre but this film , despite the obvious plot holes and - twists , did have something going for it . <sssss> namely it being suspenseful and disturbing -lrb- getting to you -rrb- which can not be said of e.g. hostel or saw . <sssss> unfortunately , at times the story is just too unbelievable , but that is perhaps why it is called a horror -lrb- that being also the reason i do n't particularly like this genre -rrb- . <sssss> what is truly a shame about it , is the way it developed towards the end . <sssss> i feel imagination was having dinner somewhere when the screenwriters were about half way into the story . <sssss> if u want to complain only about bad acting or poor directing , there are numerous movies especially in this genre that deserve some bitchin ' . <sssss> on the balance and in the case of slade and of wilson and page that really makes no sense . <sssss> just do n't compare this flick to the classic thriller . <sssss> it 's true that the dialog is pretty repetitive but i believe it to serve the story . <sssss> it frustrates the viewer in a way that it makes the predicament of jeff come alive . <sssss> all in all its just the story taking a very bad turn but i would n't go as far as calling this one a stinker . <sssss> points for : acting :8 directing :8 cinematography :8 story :3 dialog :6 this could have been a lot worse and it 's still worth a seeing . <sssss> 6/10 
ur7969168/		\tt0427309		6		while we are treated with great set-designs , acting and cinematography , i thought this film to lack focus and failing to communicate what it was supposed to be . <sssss> someone compared the film to the rocky movies and he or she surely had a point . <sssss> but where the rocky movies tried to focus on the actual boxing , providing clear moments of tension , the great debate was n't at all so much about the actual debate . <sssss> and the way the debates took place , although maybe historical correct , was not really exciting to watch . <sssss> the film 's focus lies on the subplots of racial drama which almost makes the debates feel secondary . <sssss> and although the message is clear and important , it is not something you have n't already seen in dozens of other movies . <sssss> the overall way the movie is structured is formulaic with a love-story here and a defeat for the there -lrb- which is historically incorrect -rrb- and therefore makes it a predictable watch , especially in the last half of the movie . <sssss> all in all i felt that the movie could have been much more entertaining if they had focused more on the underdog position of the team and the actual moments of debate . <sssss> the way they easily kept winning their arguments despite their background , made them not even be real underdogs . <sssss> this resulted in a bit of a listless walk-through towards the inevitable challenge against the harvard team with an outcome suiting a typical hollywood production . <sssss> 6/10

ur1578251/		\tt0286716		10		this is your only spoiler warning ... when understood that no `` comic book '' movie is good acting or storytelling , this is great . <sssss> raimi , like lee , is invested in his camera , but ` spider ' was n't able to innovate . <sssss> it was stuck in ` batman forever ' visuals . <sssss> ` crouching tiger ' never caught on with me . <sssss> i found it dull and did n't understanding what the hype surrounding ang lee . <sssss> then i saw his ` hire ' work . <sssss> lee is a genius because he never makes two movies the same way . <sssss> this is better than ` crouching tiger ' . <sssss> i was amazed that there were some meditative malick moments scattered in the pacing . <sssss> he even copies ` the right stuff ' . <sssss> shocking . <sssss> if a smart director uses flat actors , he is using them in the `` incidental '' fashion . <sssss> bana is flat , but we knew that already . <sssss> once i got past the alliterative names , i found nolte 's to be the most interesting work yet in an adaptation . <sssss> dafoe was stuck doing the reptilian bruce campbell all over again in ` spider ' . <sssss> i think it was ` thin red line ' that finally set nolte off and here he 's better than nicholson . <sssss> i had the -lrb- mis -rrb- fortune of watching this after ` natural born killers ' . <sssss> stone 's genius for editing in ` jfk ' and ` platoon ' was absent , making a migraine . <sssss> this was different . <sssss> i have rarely experienced such skill with cutting . <sssss> ` killers ' had visual variety for no purpose , but here the edits have rhyme . <sssss> the split-screens capture the essence of comic books . <sssss> if ` terminator ' or ` raiders ' had been able to do this , we would be living in different cinematic times . <sssss> in the meantime , i 'm watching for tim ' future work because this is terrific . <sssss> this revolution took me beyond any script , acting , or even physics problems . <sssss> without it , it 's ` godzilla ' all over again . <sssss> rejoice my editing brethren , we 've found a new hit ! <sssss> that brings me to the minor quibbles . <sssss> 's sonic ability since ` private ryan ' has lost quality . <sssss> ` t2 ' was interesting , this is dull . <sssss> ironically , lee 's commentary on the dvd makes better listening . <sssss> meanwhile , muren and lantieri duplicate their ` jurassic ' water gag and ilm reuses the ` t2 ' effect . <sssss> the dominant sets are circular and the camera does n't exploit the curves . <sssss> i guess the production designer did n't learn from truffaut . <sssss> the script , of course , is a werewolf movie . <sssss> man and beast , beast in man . <sssss> trying to go any deeper than that is pointless . <sssss> one last thing . <sssss> howard shore should have done the soundtrack because he is more attuned to moods -- after working with cronenberg , fincher , and demme -- than genres . <sssss> for now , i recommend looking into the ` hire ' series of shorts for any film philosopher because it shows how open-minded hollywood is getting . <sssss> we have the `` old man '' style of frankenheimer , the energy of , woo , and lee , and the revisionist carnahan , inarritu , and ritchie . <sssss> there is also the pure hokum of tony scott . <sssss> in each you 'll see a microcosm of film with each director emphasizing different elements . <sssss> it 's the most variety since the ` alien ' series . <sssss> final analysis = = midrange material

ur10986404/		\tt0092654		10		i thoroughly enjoyed this film when i first saw it , several years ago . <sssss> many movies - even the best of the classics - while still enjoyable on subsequent viewing -lrb- s -rrb- , may be slightly less so on these occasions . <sssss> however , i enjoyed this film even more than initially . <sssss> like several others , i find that the chemistry between quaid and barkin to be realistic , sensual , and presented in complete , believable balance with their diverse characters in the story line . <sssss> barkin presents a persona for whom the adjective `` sexy '' seems insufficient . <sssss> she also warrants the old-fashioned , now passé adjectives - used in the 1940 's for , say , hayworth and turner - like `` sultry '' or `` sensual . '' <sssss> ned beatty alway delivers an outstanding performance , and john goodman and all the remaining cast were excellent , as well . <sssss> further , the new orleans setting added to the film 's dimension , and presents a nostalgic `` pre-katrina '' view when seen today . <sssss> finally , the story was well-presented , and had interesting multiple dimensions , and from beginning to climax was thoroughly well-done . <sssss> an overall outstanding picture . 
ur10986404/		\tt0053172		9		this is one of those movies which can be enjoyed on more than one level . <sssss> if one is old enough , it can be enjoyed on a nostalgic level , as an example of the antiseptic romance films of the 50 's , and the fashions of the period . <sssss> for younger viewers , it is an excellent example of these to be enjoyed for the first time . <sssss> it also is interesting in view of the subsequent lives of the two male leads , rock hudson and tony randall . <sssss> hudson , one of the handsomest , most virile presences ever on-screen , of course , lived an entirely different lifestyle in reality , and died tragically of aids . <sssss> in contrast , his `` second banana , '' tony randall , who played this role here and in other films -lrb- and never `` got the girl '' -rrb- , married as an older widower , and with his younger wife , fathered a child at an age when it was possible to become a great grandfather . <sssss> and for this type of light comedy , the movie has a plot more interesting and clever than that often found in such lighter fare . <sssss> for most scenes , as was the style of this period , and in films of this genre in the 1950 's , the leading lady would appear without a hat and full array of accessories as readily as she 'd go barefoot ; and a situation had to be extremely casual and informal , before the leading males would even wear a colored dress shirt , much less loosen or remove a tie . <sssss> in terms of the liberties which story lines can show today versus then , i recall reading that the production team had at least some discussion about possible objections that the scene where rock carries doris from her bedroom through the street -lrb- with modest pajamas and about of bed coverings -rrb- might be too immodest . <sssss> all-in-all , this movie is a pleasant , entertaining way to spend an half , and get a nostalgic look back at the 1950 's .

ur0365713/		\tt0140352		8		russell crowe is fast gaining a great reputation as one of the top hollywood actors and his performance in the insider does nothing to this . <sssss> al pacino stars as a producer on cbs 's 60 minutes who tries to get a top executive who has just been fired from a tobbaco company to come clean on their dirty tricks which get the public hooked on the in tobbaco . <sssss> pacino , for the first time , comes up against his own bosses who are frightened about losing billions through litigation from the tobbaco company . <sssss> this film is 2 and a half hours long and not for one minute did i get bored , it is totaly and more than anything it is an insight into what can and has gone on in the news reporting the cover of the dvd it says `` the insider will thrill you with its unbelivable twists and turns '' . <sssss> i 'm not sure what they are talking about there because this is hardly the sixth sense but the insider is still a great movie . <sssss> 8 out of 10 . 
ur0365713/		\tt0245674		7		i was expecting the usual teen slasher type horror with 13 ghost and a lot of this film is reminiscent of many horror movies but it also has that little bit extra that makes it above average . <sssss> the story is nothing special as is the acting but the concept of the mechanical house haunted by 13 ghosts that all are horrific in their own different way is very good and it does remind me very much of hellraiser . <sssss> the ending is poor as is the begining but what we see in the middle of the film is good and is even scary at times . <sssss> i would recommend this to most horror fans and even non horror fans . <sssss> 7 out of 10 . 
ur0365713/		\tt0118636		6		apt pupil had the potential to be a great movie . <sssss> a script by stephen king and actors such as ian mckellen should have been a great recipe for a great film but i 'm afraid it was not . <sssss> dont get me wrong , apt pupil is ok , but thats as far as goes . <sssss> the film starts well then dies off for an hour and picks up again at the end , which is a big let down . <sssss> mckellen is good as usual but its hard to be brilliant when the story is a big anti climax . <sssss> i havent read the actual book by stephen king but i would be interested to see how true it is to the story as stephen king didnt actually write the screen play . <sssss> i also feel they should have had flash backs to the time the old man was a nazi to give it a little be of realism . <sssss> 6 out of 10

ur0365713/		\tt0122143		7		at the start of this film the first thing we see is caption that says '' none of the people seen are actors '' and although this statement does make you think that the last broadcast is maybe a real documentary , in the end you feel let down because this statement is a blatant lie only said for affect . <sssss> this is the story of a group 4 men who go into the woods to look for a demon as part of their cable show '' fact or fiction '' . <sssss> while there 3 of them are butchered leaving one survivor who is convicted of their murder . <sssss> we see the film as a documentary which shows clips of the video film that the men made just before and during their deaths . <sssss> i must say , i was fooled into thinking this was genuine which only fueled my dissapointment with the ending , which without giving away the plot , is a let down . <sssss> this is simular to blair witch but also inferior . <sssss> 7 out of 10 .

ur0365713/		\tt0241303		9		having watched chocolat i so wanted to have a rant at how this film is about the fight against the bile and hatred that is religion but if i did this would distract from what is a very good film that deserves better comments than my anti religious rantings . <sssss> juliette binoche lights up this delightful film as does all the cast and it is unusual to have a film that has johnny depp in it and not have too much to say about his role . <sssss> not that it 's bad , it good ` but all the characters are so interesting and well acted he is overshadowed a little . <sssss> i would recommend this movie to anyone , it appeals to all and although two hours long , it flies by . <sssss> 9 out of 10 .

ur19707400/		\tt0829482		10		this movie reminds me of dazed and confused , but it 's better . <sssss> first of all because it 's funnier . <sssss> most of the jokes are about how ridiculous characters are and it 's portrayed very realistic , like they were a real life characters . <sssss> so most of the funny moments were conversations between characters . <sssss> what else did i like was the stylishness of this movie . <sssss> the soundtrack made this film different from others and direction made it enjoyable even at those parts which were n't funny -lrb- which did n't supposed to be funny -rrb- . <sssss> it 's not only about jokes , just like american pie this movie has a deeper meaning and the main theme of it is friendship . <sssss> so it easily beats most of the teenage comedies .

ur0680065/		\tt0848557		10		a group of young film-makers , off making a horror movie as part of their course , hear on the radio stories about something happening with the dead coming to life . <sssss> jason creed , the director of the movie , decides to use his camera to record everything that is happening as society falls apart ... diary of the dead is romero 's 5th dead movie . <sssss> however , unlike land of the dead this is not a continuation of the series . <sssss> this movie is almost a prequel to the entire saga , showing how it began but instead of setting it before night of the living dead , he 's set it in present day to allow for the use of modern technology . <sssss> george a. romero 's dead movies have always had things to say about society . <sssss> dawn of the dead for example was as much about the public 's obsession with consumerism . <sssss> land of the dead had things to say about america and it 's war on terror . <sssss> here , romero is commenting on the use -lrb- and abuse -rrb- of media in society . <sssss> romero does make some good points on how media manipulation from governments and agencies to distort the truth from the public can mean the truth can get lost . <sssss> although shot in a similar way to such movies as the blair witch project and cloverfield , the movie that comes to mind is actually a little known movie , the last broadcast , in that the footage that was shot has been edited with a voice-over and music added to turn it into a proper movie -lrb- the voice-over admits this at the start of the movie -rrb- . <sssss> the cast of unknowns are all very impressive . <sssss> as the movie progresses the group tensions surface at times , and characters change in unexpected ways . <sssss> romero has always written ` real ' people for his movies well , and again he does n't disappoint . <sssss> the gore and violence in the movie , again , are up to the usual high standards in the series . <sssss> and like his other movies , it has a bleakness that suits the story , right up to the ending . <sssss> he also stages some fantastic scenes , including near the end , a clever repeat of a sequence the film-makers were shooting at the start , only this time with real terror involved . <sssss> in a time where most young film-makers are remaking horror movies , or cramming them with extreme violence , romero has shown them you do n't have to do that . <sssss> like last years 28 weeks later , this has more intelligence than most horror movies -lrb- and for that matter a lot of bigger budgeted movies -rrb- . <sssss> it is scary , thought-provoking , clever and possibly the best horror movie for quite sometime . 
ur0680065/		\tt0373889		8		i 've not read any of the books . <sssss> i wish to make that clear from the start of the review . <sssss> the books did n't appeal to me when they first came out , but being a movie geek i have seen all the movies . <sssss> and for me , this is the best one yet . <sssss> the plot sees harry potter preparing the students for battle with voldemort , while the ministry of magic refuses to believe he has returned . <sssss> the three main actors -lrb- radcliffe , grint , watson -rrb- keep getting better with every movie . <sssss> in this one potter comes over as an angry teen , which is n't surprising given what he 's been through so far , and radcliffe does a good job . <sssss> grint is as funny at times as always but actually the best of the 3 is watson . <sssss> she has a bit more freedom here as hermione , and some of her exchanges with ron are quite funny . <sssss> the supporting cast are full of the usual cast , even if some have little to nothing to do , or say , but the best of them is imelda staunton as delores umbridge . <sssss> the new dark arts teacher may look like a nice suburban housewife in her pink outfits , but behind the nice almost friendly outward appearance , is a truly unpleasant woman , and staunton is good in the role . <sssss> the director david yates does a good job as the latest director in the chair . <sssss> he handles the action very impressively , but also handles the cast and story very well . <sssss> there are a couple of faults with the movie . <sssss> the sub-plot over harry 's first kiss is dropped rather abruptly and i feel the scenes with hagrid could have been cut . <sssss> it is a long movie , and perhaps some brutal trimming in places would have helped . <sssss> but overall these faults do n't spoil the movie . <sssss> when the action kicks in in the climax of the movie , we get to see something that up till now , in the movies anyway , we 've not seen . <sssss> some full blown magic in action . <sssss> these scenes featuring potter and his friends battling voldemort 's allies are very , very impressive , cumulating in a battle between between 2 full on wizards , that some have suggested rivals yoda in action with a light-saber in attack of the clones . <sssss> not sure i would go that far , but it is spectacular !! <sssss> i 'm told that the books get darker as the series go on . <sssss> if this standard of movie-making keeps going , then the movies will go from strength to strength . 
ur7596749/		\tt0070294		8		i have heard this movie be described as menacing and that is a great way to describe it . <sssss> this has to be one of the darkest of the haunted house movies out there . <sssss> with an extremely creepy soundtrack and an equally creepy storyline , throw in actors that can play there parts well , and you have a classic film . <sssss> four people must go to a house known as `` hell house '' and must exorcise the ghosts that torment and murder all that have gone in prior . <sssss> roddy mcdowell plays as the one surviving group members from an earlier trip . <sssss> a simple storyline , yes , but the way it holds itself up is amazing . <sssss> the acting is just excellent and convincing . <sssss> also , this movie has virtually no special effects at all . <sssss> this actually works to the movies advantage as we , the audience , must rely on the atmosphere to terrorize us . <sssss> and it works very well . <sssss> one of the all time best haunted house movies ever , this one is definitely worth buying . <sssss> 8/10 
ur7596749/		\tt0099697		10		i first saw this film back in 1991 and was not to impressed . <sssss> it was n't until about 7 years ago i decided to watch the film again and give it a second chance . <sssss> it 's a good thing i did because the film is actually rather good . <sssss> the characters are interesting enough , especially brad douriff 's character as the exterminator , but i think what makes this film worth watching was the atmosphere . <sssss> it is very dark and you get the feeling through the whole movie something is horribly wrong . <sssss> i think it was one of the better stephen king adaptations to screen -lrb- even if it is loosely based on the short story -rrb- . <sssss> i give it a 7 . <sssss> worth while for any horror buff simply for the mood of the film . 
ur1162550/		\tt0093974		8		now before anyone jumps me for saying that , i 'd like to point out a few facts . <sssss> firstly , yeah half the movie is clips from the first one , but at the time silent night , deadly night 1 was pretty much banned , so the powers that be originally wanted the director to just re-cut part 1 and call it part 2 . <sssss> but the writer & director did one better than that adding in 40 minutes of their own sheer lunacy . <sssss> so you get the best parts from part 1 -lrb- give or take a funny scene -rrb- , and you get 40 new minutes of hilarious b-movie cheese . <sssss> secondly , it 's highly quotable . <sssss> heck , i yell `` garbage day ??!! '' <sssss> to my friends from time to time . <sssss> -lrb- it 's only funnier that they never saw this film & have no clue what i 'm talking about -rrb- thirdly ... oh i could go on . <sssss> just take my word for it , it 's great high body count . <sssss> my grade : 4 out of 5 bloody machetes
