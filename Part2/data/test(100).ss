ur2480402/		\tt0085809		10		this is a stunningly beautiful movie . <sssss> the music by phillip glass is just a work of pure genius . <sssss> i can watch this movie again and again . <sssss> the final sequence of the legend 's judgment where the container falls from the sky is just unbelievable . <sssss> how was it filmed ? <sssss> it 's so amazing . <sssss> if you have not seen this film watch it - again and again ! <sssss> this must be the only movie which in a powerful way , far better than , say , `` apocalypse now '' , sums up why our current `` civilization '' might be heading for destruction . <sssss> moreover , `` '' `` '' the world and humanity allowing the viewer to benefit from a `` '' viewpoint . <sssss> in other words , we learn so much about our own life and life in general by watching it from this entirely new viewpoint of `` '' , where fast motion is used extensively . <sssss> what is mankind about ? <sssss> why are we moving so fast ? <sssss> towards what goal ? <sssss> what is nature ? <sssss> what is the driving force of nature ? <sssss> what is the pulse of the earth ? <sssss> what is our relation with ourselves , nature and other people and animals ? <sssss> moreover , i think this movie is better than the sequel `` '' . <sssss> anyway , i can not emphasize enough how brilliant `` koyaanisqatsi '' is . <sssss> watch it ! <sssss> watch it ! <sssss> watch it ! 
ur2480402/		\tt0052618		10		this is quite possible one of the best movies made about christ . <sssss> although ben hur is the main character there is quite a lot about the mythology of christ in this movie . <sssss> for its time it was probably one of the best adventure movies . <sssss> it is still excellent today but perhaps not quite as good as some of the adventure movies that came after . <sssss> however , the story is very interesting and charlton heston does a great job , just like he does in `` the planet of the apes '' . <sssss> some plot elements are perhaps a bit primitive but the good thing about this movie is the way the viewer can identify with the feelings of the main character . <sssss> we really feel his pain about the persecution of his people and family . <sssss> the movie is rightly famous for the horse race towards the end . <sssss> this is really a movie which is still relevant today also because of the mythological elements it contains . 
ur2480402/		\tt0121765		10		i was astonished to see the relatively low rating on this one . <sssss> i thought it was much better than the 1999 movie . <sssss> i did n't see the 2005 movie but i 'd like to see it . <sssss> i 've seen all the other ones also . <sssss> i think the story of anakin skywalker is very compelling . <sssss> the young boy who played skywalker in the 1999 movie really did a good job , and there is some great acting in attack of the clones as well . <sssss> for example , christopher lee in a menacing role . <sssss> moreover , i think there were some great focus on details and it had the flavor of the real star wars merchandise . <sssss> the is just great . <sssss> i mean , the mercenary . <sssss> moreover , from a science-fiction point of view it is hard to see anything more visionary these days than what came out of the star wars saga . <sssss> george lucas is a great visionary and has a great imagination which is also evident in the `` lucasfilm '' such as maniac mansion and zak mccracken . <sssss> games that had an enormous impact on me as a child . <sssss> now i look forward to watching the new indiana jones movie ... 
ur2480402/		\tt0070666		1		this movie should never have been put out in this form . <sssss> there is absolutely no coherent plot . <sssss> an example : suddenly serpico has made a total transformation , we do not know why , nor do we care . <sssss> one scene follows the next without any cause or justification . <sssss> the movie portrays new york in the 1970s like it was some kind of depressing place , or something . <sssss> it just makes everything look ugly and nasty , and still this movie is just too far out . <sssss> why should we care about these selfish and strange persons ? <sssss> the acting is also really bad . <sssss> i spotted a nurse , which just could not act , and it was hard to believe she was really a nurse . <sssss> probably i could have done a better job as extra in that movie . <sssss> i did not like the movie 12 angry men either , so , all things considered , i find sidney lumet rather overrated . <sssss> i am not sure what other movies he has done . <sssss> anyway , al pacino is much better in scarface than he is in this movie and as michael corleone in the godfather movies which is also a rather shallow performance and some nasty movies , quite frankly . 
ur0217478/		\tt0125208		4		i concur with all the comments that say read the novel by lois duncan instead . <sssss> it 's true williamson and director jim gillespie were probably right to ditch the killer , since while it worked in the book , it probably would n't work in the movie . <sssss> but they also take away character development , emotional involvement , and even logic , and substitute cliches -lrb- ironic how williamson plays straight the same cliches he mocked in scream '' -rrb- . <sssss> and while it 's true both guy parts are nothing special , phillipe and prinze are pretty bad , so you do n't care at all what happens to them . <sssss> i 'm a big fan of `` buffy the vampire slayer '' and a fan of `` party of five '' , so i like sarah michelle gellar and jennifer love hewitt , respectively . <sssss> they do try their best , and hewitt at least has something to work with , but it 's not enough . <sssss> oh , and anne heche at least distinguishes herself . 
ur0217478/		\tt0125664		10		the first time i saw andy kaufman was on the saturday night live 15th anniversary show . <sssss> in the clips from the first 5 years , they showed a few seconds of his mighty mouse thing , and i found it strange and funny . <sssss> since then , i 've seen him on old saturday night live shows , and comedian specials , and seen a few old taxi episodes -lrb- though i was never a big fan -rrb- , and found him to be quite strange , but also quite funny . <sssss> so i was really looking forward to this movie , and i was not disappointed . <sssss> i agree with the person who said to try and find out the mystery behind kaufman would have undoubtedly gotten it wrong . <sssss> instead , we get a look inside his art , and if you do n't find him funny , you 're not going to like this movie -lrb- and i have no problem with those who do n't like the movie for that reason -rrb- . <sssss> viewers may also be thrown by the fact that the movie , as demonstrated in the opening scene , is a series of `` is that real or just a put on ? '' <sssss> episodes -lrb- in a way , this reminded me of penn and teller get killed , which is similarly constructed -rrb- . <sssss> but it stays true to kaufman and his performance style , and i found it offbeat and , yes , funny . <sssss> i do have a couple of minor quibbles . <sssss> i do n't know the entire story , but there are a couple of facts fudged . <sssss> for example , the way kaufman left saturday night live is not quite true -lrb- if they had done the true story , it would have been even funnier -rrb- . <sssss> also , courtney love is not as good as she was in the people vs. larry flynt , though she does have moments . <sssss> but , as i said , those are minor quibbles . <sssss> particularly high among the virtues is , of course , jim carrey as kaufman . <sssss> it took me awhile for him to `` disappear '' into the role , as so many people said he did , but he is amazing and constantly keeps us off balance and laughing , as does the entire movie . 
ur0217478/		\tt0118954		7		i read one critic that said in this film , allen was taking everything bad anyone had ever written about him and put it into this movie , and that 's not far off the mark . <sssss> this is , in essence , stardust memories redux , and since that is by far my least favorite allen film , i was hesitant towards this film . <sssss> in addition to the whiny tone of that film -lrb- oh , i 'm so successful , i have women throwing themselves at me , my life is so empty ! <sssss> -rrb- , we get the self-flagellation of this film -lrb- not only is my life so empty , i 'm such a bastard ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> what makes it watchable are three things ; firstly , allen at least seems to recognize the hypocrisy of whining , secondly , the film seamlessly weaves between fantasy and reality , between real life and fiction , and finally , it 's often very funny . <sssss> it also contains the best work either billy crystal or demi moore have done in a while . <sssss> not vintage allen , but it 'll make you laugh . <sssss> just do n't fall into the trap of thinking it has something `` important '' to say . 
ur0217478/		\tt0166896		9		whenever i hear a movie being touted because it has no sex , violence , bad language , special effects , and so on , my b.s. detector goes off . <sssss> usually , a movie like that is sentimental hogwash which panders to people who do n't want anything to surprise them , but to affirm how superior they are to us craven folk . <sssss> so when david lynch 's the straight story began getting those kinds of reviews , i was apprehensive , especially since i was not a fan of his other `` uplifting '' story , the elephant man . <sssss> for all the stunning images and the good acting in that film , it seemed more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us . <sssss> i need n't have worried . <sssss> the straight story is an honest movie rather than a saccharine one . <sssss> most of that is due to the fact that lynch and writers john roach and mary sweeney tell it straight and simple for the most part . <sssss> there are a couple of homilies by straight i could have done without , and the shots of grain being harvested are repeated a little too much , but those are only quibbles . <sssss> there 's no heavy-handed message , no sentimental strings to jerk our emotions , and no condescension towards us and its characters . <sssss> instead , they depend on the story to build its own power , and it does , so by the final scene , we are genuinely moved . <sssss> of course , casting richard farnsworth adds realism to the part . <sssss> he really is someone who looks like he 's lived through a lot but still perseveres , and except for those homilies , the desire he has to get back together with his brother does n't seem overly sentimental , because you can sense here is someone who 's lived too long and seen too much to be driven by anger for long . <sssss> and he knows his time is running out , so he wants to make some peace , not only with his brother , but with his life . <sssss> sissy spacek also does fine , unmannered work as straight 's daughter . <sssss> and although i am a city and suburban boy , the iowa and wisconsin landscape are beautifully shot , making me want at least to visit some day . 
ur0217478/		\tt0137363		8		it seems like every year , there 's one or two films which are far from perfect but nonetheless shake us up in ways better films do n't quite do . <sssss> last year , it was bulworth , and this year , it 's arlington road . <sssss> obviously , after all that 's happened this decade in america , from waco to oklahoma city , the time is ripe for a movie to explore the cracks in the american dream which brought about events like those . <sssss> this film ultimately asks more questions than it answers , but that may just be a condition inherent to this type of film . <sssss> more troubling is two things : -lrb- 1 -rrb- though i agree with those -lrb- and i 'll try not to give away too much here -rrb- who theorize the ending changes the whole perspective of the film , there are still too many key narrative cheats -lrb- a conversation robbins supposedly had with bridges ' son seems unbelievable , and the traffic light scene near the end also is -rrb- to make it fully effective ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- the film seems a little confused of what it 's about ; it is a study of one man 's psyche , or the nation 's ? <sssss> still , arlington road should n't be dismissed . <sssss> there are troubling questions explored , and you do n't have to be a conspiracy nut to believe those so-called `` fringe '' hate groups are entering the mainstream at a frightening rate for a so-called `` civilized '' society . <sssss> the ending is also powerful , and though i understand it , more than anything else , was responsible for the delays , i applaud whoever was in charge for not changing it -lrb- though again , how they got there is another story -rrb- . <sssss> bridges ' performance is another thing which makes more sense once you look back with the ending of the film in mind , and it does n't seem like over-acting . <sssss> robbins is a little more problematic ; there are scenes where he 's convincing , and then scenes where he goes over-the-top and should n't . <sssss> hope davis does n't have a big part , but she injects a lot into it as usual . <sssss> but the biggest surprise here is joan cusack . <sssss> anyone who thinks of her only as a -lrb- good -rrb- comic actress will be in for a shock ; there 's one scene involving her which is the scariest in the film . <sssss> again , ultimately , while it leaves you with nagging doubts about the quality , arlington road makes you think enough to recommend it . 
ur0217478/		\tt0139239		9		a lot will be said about go being nothing more than a knock-off of pulp fiction . <sssss> well , yes , but if you 're going to steal , you might as well steal from the great ones . <sssss> and while go may steal , this is n't a cash-in job , like the tarantino wannabes which ape his hipness without having his talent . <sssss> director doug liman has talent ; in fact , visually , he 's ahead of tarantino with some dazzling camerawork , especially in the first story where manny -lrb- nathan bexton -rrb- is dancing with the supermarket customer to the `` macarena '' -lrb- a song i despise , but it worked here i must admit -rrb- . <sssss> and while the story structure seems less essential here than it did in pulp fiction , it still works because of the way writer john august ties them all together at the end . <sssss> of the three stories , the second is by far the weakest ; it seems too repetitive and self-indulgent . <sssss> that it gets by at all is due to newcomer desmond askew , who really does seem to be getting high on experiencing vegas for the first time . <sssss> also , taye diggs does nice work , and it 's nice to see j.e. freeman playing menacing again , even if it is with a mustache still -lrb- without it , in ruthless people , miller 's crossing , and wild at heart , he was terrifying -rrb- . <sssss> by contrast , the first and third stories are strong , not just , again , how they 're tied together , but because underneath the bored front everyone puts up , there is a sense of desperation . <sssss> ronna -lrb- sarah polley -rrb- , the supermarket cashier who takes simon 's place not just on his shift , but as drug dealer , jumps into dealing not for the thrill , but because she needs rent money to avoid getting evicted . <sssss> likewise , adam -lrb- scott wolf -rrb- and zach -lrb- jay mohr -rrb- are trying to buy from her not for the high , but to avoid getting busted by burke -lrb- william fichtner -rrb- , the rather strange narcotics detective who is using them . <sssss> and at the end , while , as ronna says , `` things did n't go exactly as planned , '' you still get a sense that things will probably work out . <sssss> all of the cast is strong ; mohr mugs less than you 'd expect , wolf has fun playing off his image , timothy olyphant cuts a menacing image as simon 's dealer todd -lrb- and later shows an unexpected side without getting sentimental -rrb- , and while katie holmes does n't have much to do at first as ronna 's friend claire , she 's appealing as always , especially when she does come into her own . <sssss> but the standouts are fichtner and polley . <sssss> like freeman , fichtner is best known for playing sleazes -lrb- the underneath , strange days , albino alligator -rrb- , and indeed looks a little like the master of menace , christopher walken . <sssss> but here , he shows an unexpected comic side when he reveals his true purpose , or when he 's demonstrating the real way to cuff someone . <sssss> and polley shows true talent and instinct here , knowing exactly how to play each scene and capturing perfectly the cynical , deadpan attitude most of the characters -lrb- or people her age -rrb- have . <sssss> and she makes you believe in ronna 's ability to improvise her way out of trouble . <sssss> this did n't do too well its first weekend , but i hope it finds an audience on video , for this deserves to be known for more than being a copy of tarantino . <sssss> it 's a lot of fun . 
ur4751428/		\tt0045793		8		movies are one of the things i love the most in my life , and i really want to know about the things i love . <sssss> so i believe that in order to appreciate films , you should watch everything ; to become a cultured person in the matter . <sssss> not just watch the contemporary films , or in descartes mode , watch only the films made after i was born . <sssss> everything includes classics like `` from here to eternity '' . <sssss> made in black and white : with pure passion . <sssss> while i watched i tried to think about the way movies were made at those times . <sssss> the power the big female stars like deborah kerr had , the money actors like burt lancaster made per movie , the low budget of the projects , the little shooting time . <sssss> what were the results ? <sssss> in the case of `` from here to eternity '' ; an oscar winning film where everything fits perfectly . <sssss> because it was not easy to make it work , or at i least that 's what i think . <sssss> i think that at the time there was an honest cinema , with lots of true spoken words . <sssss> nowadays we have p.t. anderson and his encounters between people , but in the 50 's it took a man named daniel taradash to make moving a two people chat . <sssss> when private prewitt -lrb- montgomery clift -rrb- arrives in schofield , he has a little `` catch-up '' talk with a soldier . <sssss> in three minutes , with words , we understand the essence of clift 's character . <sssss> the army is his life ; and he 's destined to end his days there . <sssss> he 'll have his problems , he 'll have to fight , he 'll have to gain his place , but that 's how things go with the hero . <sssss> then he 'll meet his woman alma -lrb- donna reed -rrb- and fight for love , too . <sssss> but it 's not just about him and his love story . <sssss> there 's another man , prewitt 's superior ; sergeant milton warden -lrb- burt lancaster -rrb- , who has another superior , captain dana holmes . <sssss> however , holmes goes out with friends and the honorable warden does all the work . <sssss> from time to time , holmes ' wife karen -lrb- deborah kerr -rrb- visits the base , and the sergeant approaches . <sssss> later both of them experience two of the most romantic scenes i 've ever witnessed . <sssss> and here comes an issue probably discussed many times . <sssss> in a movie where the character that highlights the most is prewitt , montgomery clift is second-billed , and lancaster is first . <sssss> yet lancaster goes into the water and the sand with deborah kerr , third-billed . <sssss> who is the leading man ? <sssss> lancaster or clift ? <sssss> and if they 're both leading men , why is clift 's woman supporting actress and not lancaster 's ? <sssss> well , supposing the latter four are the `` leading team '' , each of their performances is incredible and impossible to detail about . <sssss> on the other hand , supporting performances or a supporting performance is from another world . <sssss> frank sinatra 's angelo maggio is priceless . <sssss> we do n't get many given friends in today 's cinema . <sssss> in a story like this one , prewitt needed someone beside him , and that little guy was there from the start until the end . <sssss> they 'll meet again . <sssss> the work of fred zinnemann -lrb- `` cine '' is cinema in spanish , and `` zine '' . <sssss> . <sssss> zine man : the man of the cinema -rrb- is wondrous too . <sssss> now the final product of a film depends of lots of people , and influences come from different parts of a production ; but i think back then the director was like a king . <sssss> it was his word in his world or something like that . <sssss> zinnemann 's camera always makes close ups in the characters ' faces . <sssss> maybe he believed it was very important to show feelings and maybe the face is the part of the body that expresses them best . <sssss> i would do the same . 
ur4751428/		\tt0446755		9		interestingly , i got to this film not because of its two leads but because of its director . <sssss> the man is john curran , an independent director with a profound vision who is riding the right path and if he continues to do so , i dare to say he 'll be among the big names soon . <sssss> that 's , of course , if he decides to work more constantly . <sssss> he 's done three full-length features that have garnered awards and recognition . <sssss> i 've seen two of them ; `` we do n't live here anymore '' and now `` the painted veil '' , the life of a couple in the 1920 's , where a man came to a woman after knowing her for a day and said : `` i came here to ask you to marry me '' . <sssss> this is what dr. walter fane -lrb- edward norton -rrb- proposes to kitty -lrb- naomi watts -rrb- ; and she agrees , of course because it 's a chance to get as far away from her parents as possible . <sssss> fane is a microbiologist or something like it , however she does n't care . <sssss> he takes her to shanghai , where she meets charlie townsend -lrb- liev schreiber -rrb- . <sssss> something awful and predictable happens . <sssss> it hurts a character and the viewer and it lets curran to deal with a theme he knows well ; adultery . <sssss> anyway , this is just the beginning of a silent suffering and of a silent life with limited conversations . <sssss> but strong conversations , coming from ron nyswaner 's intelligent script , based on w. somerset maugham 's novel . <sssss> overlooked by the academy , nyswaner 's work allows the characters to expose their feelings mercilessly ; which is exactly the way john curran makes films . <sssss> in `` we do n't live here anymore '' the images were violent . <sssss> `` do you absolutely despise me ? '' <sssss> , kitty asks walter . <sssss> `` no , i despise myself for allowing myself to love you once '' , he answers . <sssss> in scenes like this one , curran 's close-ups are daring ; but he 's also able to measure his shots to give us some beautiful landscapes . <sssss> going back to nyswaner , he achieves the turn of the story perfectly , providing us a big gallery of characters -lrb- toby jones as an unpredictable neighbor , anthony wong chau-sang as a harsh chinese colonel , diana rigg as a caring nun -rrb- as he deals with strong issues like terminal diseases and social differences . <sssss> sometimes recognized as the most intelligent man in the industry , a versatile and underrated actor , norton produced the movie -lrb- in which he 's absolutely brilliant , with the english accent included -rrb- and made sure naomi watts was in it ... every time she appears on screen in a film she looks different ; although we know it 's her . <sssss> her range is more surprising by the day . <sssss> not so long ago , watts said in an interview that she was tired of dramatic roles where she had to cry all the time ; she wanted to get a big paycheck in `` some stupid romantic comedy '' . <sssss> even so , she produced curran 's previous movie -lrb- where she was also great -rrb- and co-produced this one : she must care a little bit . <sssss> ultimately , with all the things it covers , `` the painted veil '' is a beautiful story about love found , as in discovered ; a story about regret and the purest forgiveness . <sssss> i also want to comment that after watching two of his pieces , curran has something going on with streets in last scenes . 
ur4751428/		\tt0120202		8		i have , for seven years , been waiting to see this film . <sssss> i always tell the story about the time i went with some friends to the cinema and convinced everyone to watch this film and once inside the theater everyone wanted to go because they did n't like what they were watching but i wanted to stay because i liked it very much . <sssss> and because i think there 's a time for movies and that they arrive when they arrive , i have just found david mamet 's `` state and main '' and , luckily , i 've liked it very much . <sssss> of course , it 's a special movie , but not in the sense that it 's not for everyone . <sssss> it 's an easy-going movie , with a clear and simple plot line , nice sceneries and a cinematography that does n't take any risks ; but i could merely recommend , with enthusiasm , that everyone who watches assume a commitment . <sssss> what do i mean by this ? <sssss> well , that if you pay more attention than usual you should really enjoy it . <sssss> the thing is that `` state and main '' is a movie about a movie , and it 's written by david mamet , fact that naturally makes it not ` any ' movie about a movie . <sssss> i 'll take a risk and say that this is based on one of mamet 's plays -lrb- i do n't know that for a fact -rrb- , because it looks very theatrical , but with the exceptional cast -lrb- by genius kaufman -rrb- and theodore shapiro 's shifting score , we quickly forget about it . <sssss> we do n't forget , however , what may originally have come from a play ; and that 's mamet 's use of language . <sssss> from scene one , where a doctor encounters a patient on the street and walt -lrb- william h. macy -rrb- argues with his team about the place they 've ended up in , the writer/director establishes a style in his screenplay that we feel throughout the whole ride and contains certain characteristics : sharp , witty , direct , humorous and , at surprising times , reflexive and profound . <sssss> walt is a director who comes to shoot a film to waterford , vermont ; the place they 've ended up in : the middle of nowhere . <sssss> the fact that waterford is a little town where everyone has a big smile on their faces and do n't seem to have problems -lrb- julia stiles ' perfect working teenager ; rebecca pidgeon 's kind and loving annie ; charles durning 's mayor -rrb- , helps to establish a contrast with the neurotic director and his hollywood crew : the manipulative and unstoppable producer marty -lrb- a wonderful david paymer -rrb- ; the popular star with a ` thing ' for minors bob -lrb- the role alec baldwin knows by heart -rrb- ; the pretty and stupid popular actress -lrb- sarah jessica parker , in the role that suits her quite well -rrb- ; and the character with which you should implement my recommendation of paying attention : the creative , insecure writer of the film , joe , played by the great philip seymour hoffman . <sssss> stereotypes ? <sssss> why not some of them ? <sssss> but manet is so gifted that , instead of assuming a character is stereotyped , he gives them lines for us to recognize , through their personality , the stereotype they represent . <sssss> this sound simple , but it 's not . <sssss> it 's the same i try to say about `` state and main '' : it looks simple , and it can be ; but it does n't have to be if you want it to . <sssss> if you want , you can put yourselves in joe the writer 's position and try to figure out the truth , whatever it may be . <sssss> if you want , you can enter as an outsider to the world of making a film and what it has to offer ; to the political aspirations and perspectives of a little town ; to the tradition and the stories and the sense of home of a little town . <sssss> mamet knows all of these things , and here sometimes he takes a stand ; he sometimes mocks , other times he praises , most of the time he makes no sense at all , but all the time he 's showing these things to us , in any form you may want to take them . <sssss> and what 's what cinema essentially does ? 
ur4751428/		\tt0458352		5		that meryl streep has been oscar nominated for a role in a movie like `` the devil wears prada '' simply speaks of her unique talent as an actress and of lots years and experience in the business to choose the right characters to play . <sssss> i would have preferred a nomination for her work in `` a prairie home companion '' ; it would have been a tribute to robert altman . <sssss> but true : the presence she had there is n't comparable to the one she has as this devil . <sssss> miranda priestly is the name of the non-human -lrb- is the best expression i can think of -rrb- character streep portrays . <sssss> fortunately for her , the movie makes clear that miranda is not human and it constantly finds a new example so we can see it on screen . <sssss> so when andy -lrb- anne hathaway -rrb- arrives to be this devil 's new second assistant , a job apparently ' a million girls would kill for ' , she makes very clear that this is just a normal job for her , because she takes work seriously and she wants to be a journalist . <sssss> nevertheless , miranda ruthlessly throws her a bunch of activities that the most prodigious mind could n't even remember instantly ; and she just tells andy . <sssss> that 's the way things work at `` runway '' , the important fashion magazine where miranda is the queen . <sssss> emily -lrb- emily blunt -rrb- , the devil 's first assistant -lrb- yes , she has two -rrb- , gives andy an explanation of the routine on the first day : `` you just stay on the desk and pick up the phone , you ca n't move if i 'm not here '' . <sssss> `` but if i want to go the bathroom ? '' <sssss> , andy asks . <sssss> `` you ca n't ; once a girl chopped her finger with a stapler and had to stay because the phone was ringing '' . <sssss> two days later , andy goes to her 15-minute lunch break and when she has chosen her food , nigel -lrb- stanley tucci -rrb- comes and says she must leave it because miranda has called and she always arrives fifteen minutes early . <sssss> when andy gets to the office , emily yells at her because she has to pee and she 's been holding it for ten minutes . <sssss> this people ca n't even eat and they talk almost exactly the way i 'm saying they do . <sssss> what happens is that andy wears old sweaters and long ugly skirts her boyfriend -lrb- adrian greiner -rrb- loves but that are not classy enough to work in a fashion magazine . <sssss> plus , she does n't care about fashion and she says it out loud , which apparently is a crime . <sssss> in one scene , miranda looks at one of andy 's old sweaters and gives her lesson about its origin and about how it relates so deeply to fashion . <sssss> that one-minute talk alone is worth streep 's oscar nomination ; because in the film 's heartless world , she shows no heart . <sssss> i have n't read lauren weisberger 's novel , but aline brosh mckenna has adapted a work that ended up in a script that has no sense of reality at all . <sssss> i repeat : a person does n't work like this , a person does n't talk like this , a person does n't live like this , a person does n't do or say these things . <sssss> david frankel directed the film the same way ; showing the million different outfits the wonderful costume design offers and shooting each night event with all the glamour and style . <sssss> it did n't help ; i became completely aware of it when the picture introduced an incredibly dreamed character played by simon baker . <sssss> all the cast is exceptional really ; it has young british talented actresses , it has tucci at his best form , it has anne hathaway delivering well -lrb- and most importantly showing that she 's not a vehicle actress and she can do different things -rrb- and of course , meryl streep . <sssss> the plot line takes a turn at some point and it becomes shamefully predictable ; but it occurs when you do n't care about these characters anymore . 
ur4751428/		\tt0457513		7		i have discovered two things . <sssss> the first one is pretty interesting and evident and it is that woody allen is falling in love with the city of london , because he 's done two inspired films there ; the second one is understandable and obvious : woody allen has fallen in love with scarlett johansson ... and who has n't ? <sssss> these two facts lead two `` scoop '' , the second movie of the inspired allen london works , which has scarlett johansson as the leading lady . <sssss> `` scoop '' went clearly unnoticed -lrb- as in unappreciated -rrb- in the united states , surely because allen premiered it too soon after the brilliant `` match point '' and the public was n't able to digest it . <sssss> i 'm not saying that `` scoop '' is another masterpiece , but if people had paid more attention , the results would have been cherished . <sssss> after all , it is allen 's best crime/comedy work in years ; his best comedy since `` hollywood ending '' -lrb- `` anything else '' was not good -rrb- and the best mix since `` the curse of the jade scorpion '' . <sssss> it 's also a blessing to have the man himself back in the cast , after he 's given the responsibility to play his self-written roles to young actors like jason biggs and to interesting choices like will ferrell . <sssss> if woody allen writes a film , the best actor to play the kind of masculine parts he creates is woody allen . <sssss> those exaggeratedly manic , hyperactive and demonstrative men we know by heart . <sssss> this time he has chosen a magician called sidney who every time he uses a member of the audience to perform a trick , gives the same speech : `` i want you to know that , with all due respect , i think you 're a beautiful person and i love you ... i say it from the bottom of my heart and i mean it '' . <sssss> the lucky lady that one day gets to be onstage with sydney is sondra -lrb- johansson -rrb- , an aspiring journalist who , in the middle of the magic trick , meets a dead recognized reporter -lrb- ian mcshane -rrb- that tells her the scoop : `` peter lyman is the tarot killer the police is looking for '' . <sssss> soon , both magician and girl are in the middle of a strategy to meet lyman , the son of an english lord . <sssss> hugh jackman plays this character with all the manners and vocabulary of a respected english gentleman who , of course , does n't seem a killer at all . <sssss> events unfold with the usual allen style and a similar line of technical work that what we saw in `` match point '' . <sssss> again , the director looks for shots that explore the places the characters meet , moving the camera from one side to another ; and the look of london is n't a lot different of the one he presented in his last picture . <sssss> with a beautiful cinematography by remi adefarasin , allen made the right call when choosing the british again for the job . <sssss> however , he 's made a little change in the music choice . <sssss> leaving the opera aside , he 's selected classical music that 's been correctly edited to generate the necessary dramatic impact on the most striking scenes . <sssss> luckily , his work with actors is intact and if he 's fallen for scarlett johansson he 's fallen for good ; because he gets the best out of her . <sssss> but watching the old allen doing his thing at this age and doing it with style is no more than priceless . 
ur4751428/		\tt0115988		5		the late arthur miller wrote lots of things ; among them a play called `` the crucible '' . <sssss> on 1996 , nicholas directed the first american cinematographic version of miller 's play , and miller himself ended up writing the screenplay of the film . <sssss> the story unfolds in salem , where the teenage girls are going crazy about witchery in some people . <sssss> i 've seen many films that take place in old time and have characters which give a lot of importance to god and the religion ; `` the crucible '' is like that and that 's the only reason the movie lasts longer than it should , because it 's obvious for the viewers that the teenagers are pretending every part of their act , but judge danforth -lrb- paul scofield -rrb- , reverend parris -lrb- bruce davison -rrb- and reverend hale -lrb- rob campbell -rrb- are very confident in the fact that it could be true . <sssss> the teenage girls are led to their actions by abigail williams , played by winona ryder in one of those performances full of strength and moving power during a time where the world was hers and she could act alongside daniel day-lewis and joan allen without seeming out of place . <sssss> she starts with these witchery accusations because she had an affair wit john proctor -lrb- day-lewis -rrb- and wants his wife elizabeth -lrb- allen -rrb- in jail . <sssss> ryder 's character is a kid ; a teenager in love who makes choices and says things always in the verge of despair ; without thinking . <sssss> so here the performances appear in order of growth . <sssss> ryder , with her desperation ; day-lewis , who seems so dramatic but at the same time so real in the acceptance of the mistake he has made ; and allen , whose look is full of sadness and incomprehension of the role she has ended up playing . <sssss> the rest of the cast shares the sense of drama of their partners , especially bruce davison , who is shouting all the time and making absurd accusations ; or rob campbell , who suspects he might be living a lie and starts going crazy in front of people . <sssss> the film 's major achievement in my opinion lies in the technical work , without underestimating the work of the cast . <sssss> therefore the picture sustains its two hours because of the solid portrayals the actors do ; because of the cinematography and the production design which make the film look a lot older than the time it was made in ; and because of the peculiar editing that my brother disliked but gives a darker tone to the creepy environment presented . <sssss> arthur miller has no fault in what happened , because it could be a slow and tedious screenplay that betrayed the film ; but it is n't . <sssss> i 've seen lots of good films with slow screenplays and even more plays with tedious ones . <sssss> `` the crucible '' must be a very entertaining ride on a theater stage , but it 's just that not every successful play turned into a film will be successful too ; and here you have an example . 
ur4751428/		\tt0478311		9		picture a passionate scene ... a guy and a girl are about to have sex and he 's having troubles with his condom ; he ca n't seem to be able to put it on . <sssss> the girl says : `` just do it already '' . <sssss> maybe a normal guy would interpret the phrase as what it means , but not ben stone -lrb- seth rogen -rrb- : he throws the condom to the floor ... and he gets alison -lrb- katherine heigl -rrb- pregnant . <sssss> i have n't laughed so hard with a movie since i do n't know when . <sssss> `` knocked up '' is a romantic comedy unlike any romantic comedy and better than the average romantic comedy . <sssss> the reason ? <sssss> i would have to say judd apatow : the guy who gave `` fun with dick and jane '' its few laughs , the writer/director of `` the 40 year old virgin '' and the mastermind behind this . <sssss> apatow really knows how to have fun . <sssss> characters the same names as the actors who play them , freshness in each scene , unexpected comedic resolutions during typical moments ; that is all apatow . <sssss> take this for example , continuing with what i wrote in the first paragraph . <sssss> alison and ben wake up after having sex and leave the house for breakfast . <sssss> they encounter alison 's sister debbie -lrb- a brilliant leslie mann -rrb- and his husband pete -lrb- a brilliant paul rudd -rrb- with their two little kids . <sssss> `` do n't ever do what they just did '' , pete tells his four-year-old daughter . <sssss> `` i 'm gon na do it '' , she answers . <sssss> or another scene where debbie thinks pete is cheating on her ; finds an address and goes there with ben and alison to check it out . <sssss> she 's angry , and as soon as she leaves the car , ben asks alison : `` is she carrying a gun ? '' <sssss> . <sssss> the audience does n't expect these lines and the laughs flow naturally . <sssss> if they are improvised or not is unimportant ; what matters is that apatow is directing them and allows their inclusion in the film . <sssss> if there 's one problem with `` knocked up '' is that it runs a little bit long , but it does n't make it worse than the wonder it is . <sssss> it is a wonder because in its long duration , it manages to combine comedy , drama and romance in an enviable way . <sssss> it 's not always the most active movie , but it does n't have to be ; it 's not always funny and sometimes it is when it 's not supposed to ; it 's romantic in the most classic way and it 's helped by a classic plot line with zero surprises . <sssss> however , in all this predictable plot line , `` knocked up '' has a quality that only few comedies achieve : it knows its time -lrb- s -rrb- . <sssss> besides , it creates its own language and it makes us part of it very quickly ; it takes the chance to be critical about the hollywood business with intelligent humor . <sssss> but most importantly -lrb- and this was also palpable in `` the 40 yea old virgin '' -rrb- , and as another rare characteristic , it truly cares for its characters who are interesting , flawed and real human beings . <sssss> seth rogen constructs a lovable creature , like one of those big bears you want to hug , surpassing the promise he showed in ` virgin ' ; while katherine heigl looks more beautiful than in `` grey 's anatomy '' and creates a completely different and believable character from her izzie stevens . <sssss> when i wrote about ` virgin ' i said apatow was more a planner than a director ... he still is , if we consider eric edward 's cinematography , with very little creativity . <sssss> but the directing side of apatow comes to light from another side : from the double sense of names -lrb- ben stone ; you 'll see once you 're inside the movie -rrb- , from little posters in rooms and books in bookstores and photographs and references that seem to declare his inspirations . <sssss> then , we can see him through these things . <sssss> we can see the man behind the camera , and let me tell you it 's a good place the one where he comes from . 
ur4751428/		\tt0275719		8		richard linklater is your guy when it comes to a little number of people or a focused and limited space . <sssss> `` tape '' is probably one of the best examples of his craft as a director , because he did not write the script , and it involves only three characters in the same place : a hotel room . <sssss> for less than an hour and half , linklater takes these people to heaven , drags them to hell ; and takes them up and down for a while more . <sssss> ok : i might be exaggerating a little , but not too much . <sssss> the tension and unusual suspense we find in a small room in `` tape '' is comparable to the typical one we find in a whole city in `` the sixth sense '' . <sssss> i 'm talking about the unusual suspense that makes you want to bite your nails because you feel as nervous as the characters . <sssss> based on his own stage play , stephen belber 's script narrates the encounter vince -lrb- linklater regular ethan hawke -rrb- and john -lrb- robert sean leonard -rrb- , two very good friends , have with amy -lrb- uma thurman -rrb- , about something that happened ten years before , during high school . <sssss> vince is a , john a filmmaker and amy a district attorney ... i 'll leave it there . <sssss> the film has a theater play look ; but it is essentially a film . <sssss> this is what linklater never forgets when he is working : that he is making movies . <sssss> you would n't get his multiple shots , unpredictable close-ups that seem amateurish on purpose on a theater stage . <sssss> and it is true that the magic of theater is that you do n't get a second chance if you mess up but , to tell the truth ; `` tape '' looks like it was shot without pause , or at least linklater makes us believe so . <sssss> it 's a delicate work by maryse alberti and sandra adair , director of photography and editor , respectively . <sssss> the film changes the mood constantly and the camera is the main element present to show that , while the edition must go along with it . <sssss> the way in which the characters ask daring questions and raise the tone of their voices is accurately shown in this attentive technical work . <sssss> the performances are the core of the piece and , thanks to linklater , are unquestionably top - notch . <sssss> angry and ironical , ethan hawke plays vince in an over the top way that 's not enough over the top to still seem real . <sssss> robert sean leonard , who made a decent career after his young success with `` dead poets society '' -lrb- where hawke also appears -rrb- and is now a respectable actor , constructs a restrained but distrustful portrayal about a man who always looks about to explode . <sssss> finally , uma thurman commits herself with a performance that combines beauty and innocence with intelligence and unpredictability in a logical way . <sssss> there 's something special about the performances ; about the way in which the characters -lrb- especially hawke -rrb- say common words like `` what '' or `` how '' or `` why '' , and it increases the amusement of the experience . <sssss> the title `` tape '' comes from something ethan hawke 's character records in a cassette . <sssss> you 'll see what it is and how pointless it appears to be ; but then you 'll see how linklater and his direction , 's script and their movie manage to turn it into the most important thing in the world . 
ur4751428/		\tt0087277		5		the opening credits of `` footloose '' are a blast . <sssss> the camera shoots the feet of several people doing different dance steps while a catchy music plays on the back . <sssss> there 's a chance you miss the credits because the movement of the feet may distract you ; i think that 's effective . <sssss> i also think the first ten minutes of the film are effective : with the camera showing different views of what 's clearly a small town and then taking us to church , where reverend moore -lrb- john lithgow -rrb- gives a speech about how dancing corrupts the spirit of young children . <sssss> when the mass is over , we see the reverend 's beautiful daughter ariel -lrb- lori singer -rrb- and her friends in a car racing tough guy chuck 's van -lrb- jim youngs -rrb- , and unexpectedly ariel gets out of the car through the window and stands in the middle of the two vehicles , knowing that a truck is coming from the other side . <sssss> she does n't die , but we understand the movie makes a statement : a girl is angry at her father because he is forbidding freedom among teenagers , and controls her all the time and does n't let her live her life . <sssss> this is not an unfamiliar plot line , and although it 's interesting , the movie provides something more interesting yet : ren mccormack . <sssss> played by kevin bacon with the enough amount of cockiness and the necessary humanity , ren is the new guy in this little town and he 's about to bring trouble because he dances well and he wants everyone to dance . <sssss> however , that 's as interesting as it gets . <sssss> i wo n't tell you anything else about the plot because i believe everybody needs to experience a film in their own way and draw their own conclusions , but i have to tell you that my experience of `` footloose '' was a disappointing one . <sssss> yes , there 's good music and choreographies , and kevin bacon 's work is risky and worthy of admiration -lrb- so is chris penn 's as his best friend willard -rrb- , but there 's absolutely nothing more . <sssss> as we wait for a new song to start playing , direct herbet ross struggles to keep our attention and cover the big holes in dean pitchford 's script -lrb- there are moments where this is impossible and we 're stuck with excessive minutes of background music -rrb- . <sssss> take any conversation , any situation ; only one is enough to see how narrow-minded pitchford 's writing is . <sssss> and it 's not narrow-minded because the characters inhabit a narrow-minded little town : it 's narrow-minded in its nature , and it makes it impossible to us to connect with any of the characters or even remember their names -lrb- try to remember the name of ren 's mother by the end of the movie -rrb- . <sssss> asked me one time about the name of a guy that appears a lot in the film , but it seems more an accessory than a character . <sssss> after one day in school , ren is driving the streets with a bunch of guys we do n't care about . <sssss> okay , maybe we should n't , but the script 's greatest fault is failing in the development of the one character we should at least relate to . <sssss> if you think about an instant reason for ren and his mother to be in a new town , you wo n't find it . <sssss> and the movie provides reasons for this situation and many others , but it does it during the wrong moments . <sssss> every time an honest confession comes out of a character 's mouth , we 're not ready for it and we 're not able to fully digest it . <sssss> i felt there was a problem of connection between each scene ; that everything was either moving too fast or moving in an unexpected way , like the confession . <sssss> sometimes the unexpected is good : not here . <sssss> you see ... satine had feelings , she was trapped in a situation and we felt for her -lrb- this is `` moulin rouge ! '' <sssss> -rrb- ; roxie hart had aspirations , dreams -lrb- this is `` chicago '' -rrb- . <sssss> ren mccormack apparently has all this things too , but when the film gives him the possibility to stand by them , two times ; the first one he 's not convincing enough and the second one the movie skips the scene . <sssss> of course you could say it 's a musical and the story is less important and not to be taken seriously and other things , and that 's why i put the examples above ; but this is partly . <sssss> the fact is , and this can be denied because it 's something patent throughout the film , that the story of `` footloose '' and the emotions of the characters are filled with seriousness : it 's the filmmakers ' intention for us to take it seriously . <sssss> and if that 's not so , then i 've seen another movie .

ur0116181/		\tt0120789		10		it is no surprise that gary ross -- the writer of big and dave -- once again brings a very smart comedy to the big screen , but what is surprising is the level of directorial stewardship that he brings to a very complex undertaking . <sssss> pleasantville is a wonderful laugh-out-loud satire that deals with issues such as racism , fascism , artistic freedom , individuality , sexual mores , 90 's amorality , group control and some other things i probably missed . <sssss> but ross wraps his messages in ambiguity and , most importantly , entertainment . <sssss> any movie that uses don knotts effectively has really got its wits about it . <sssss> the performances from every single actor -- including extras -- are kubrickian in their perfection and often hilarious . <sssss> tobey maguire , reese witherspoon and joan allen are standouts in this standout cast . <sssss> maguire is very good at showing the thought processes going on inside his head behind his eyes . <sssss> witherspoon 's vixen is devious without being mean . <sssss> and allen , like she did in face/off , brings a heart and soul that is key to the amazing things going on around her and to her . <sssss> this movie tops there 's something about mary on the laugh meter and furthermore the way allen 's scene in the bathtub pays off is as outrageous as ... mary 's hair gel scene . <sssss> the first hour of this movie is as funny as anything i 've ever seen . <sssss> i have n't even mentioned the `` look '' of this film yet . <sssss> it is fantastic . <sssss> the seamless blend of color and black-and-white ceases to become an issue very early on . <sssss> you accept this parallel universe for what it is and that is the highest compliment you can pay to the effects crew . <sssss> fortunately ross does n't miss any opportunity to use it for laughs and social comment . <sssss> some people have criticized the movie for waffling on the themes it speaks to , but i feel that any ambiguity that ross built into the script was simply meant to avoid any preaching and let the audience make up its own mind about what the movie means . <sssss> my only real criticism of pleasantville is that it may be a bit too ambitious for its own good , but i 'd much rather have a movie that tries too hard than too little . <sssss> next to saving private ryan this is my favorite film this year so far . 
ur0116181/		\tt0077416		10		there are a handful of truly excellent movies that i only want to experience once and this is one of them . <sssss> michael cimino 's sweeping portrait of men drafted into war to commit atrocities against other men is harrowing . <sssss> the survivors suffer more than the dead . <sssss> i know a lot of knee-jerk liberals read a lot of jingoistic patriotism into cimino 's script especially when the movie ended with singing of the star spangled banner -lrb- or another `` patriotic '' song -rrb- , but i saw it as a ironic , if not sardonic , touch . <sssss> this film could have been set in any war . <sssss> i did n't see it as being specifically about vietnam and thus the hotly debated use of russian roulette throughout the movie was an extremely effective metaphor rather than an historical fact or fiction . <sssss> -lrb- i could care less whether it actually was used as a torture technique or not -- all i know is that is moved me to the depths of my soul . <sssss> -rrb- i was moved to tears by it . <sssss> and of course the acting was brilliant . <sssss> deniro gives one of best performances ever -lrb- and that is saying a lot -rrb- and he is matched by an excellent supporting cast . <sssss> but as powerful as deniro is who can ever forget christopher walken 's shattering performance in his oscar winning role ? <sssss> the effect that man 's capacity for inhumanity had on him and everybody else was as tough to to watch as anything in movie history . <sssss> his death was real shocker -lrb- in a very bad sense -rrb- and i do n't even like remembering it as i write this . <sssss> the deerhunter is easily one of the top 20 films i 've ever seen and is probably a top 10 pick . <sssss> its oscars were richly deserved .

ur1593801/		\tt0478311		1		i was uncomfortable through out this film , having to watch stereotype after stereotype , mean-spirited `` jokes '' and juvenile toilet humour . <sssss> let 's look at the good : leslie mann : her shallow , annoying character was played very well by ms. mann ; and by the end , she was even somewhat sympathetic . <sssss> harold ramis : his two-minute scene was the only truly likable character in this entire film . <sssss> i loved him . <sssss> paul rudd : despite his fatalistically brow-beaten character , rudd was genuinely good . <sssss> too bad his character was `` resigned '' to what looked like a life not worth living . <sssss> the bad : the jab at a guy like stephen hawking . <sssss> yeah ; this film sinks that low . <sssss> the stereotype that `` pot-heads '' are all unemployed , long-haired dopes with prurient life goals ; think again ... heigl with rogen 's character ? <sssss> no way . <sssss> this is a guy who grabbed his bong during an earthquake without a thought to her safety . <sssss> i could relate to her exasperation with ben and his friends ... but ending up with him ? <sssss> sure ... the conversations about munich were very insensitive ; but then , this entire film was , so at least it was consistent . <sssss> endorsing de beers ?? <sssss> the toilet humour . <sssss> . <sssss> really . <sssss> the reference to a woman 's anatomy using the c-word , more than once , is misogynistic and really dumb . <sssss> the kids , played by apatows daughters , were cute ; but i felt like they were being exploited . <sssss> `` i googled murder '' today ? <sssss> lovely . <sssss> that list with the canadian beavers , headed by pamela anderson , lolita davidovich , natasha henstridge , and another woman , was n't funny for me . <sssss> even the second bar scene , where mann and heigl , who had previously pushed their way to the front of the line without a thought to `` the ugly people '' waiting in line , did n't play out as sympathetic at all . <sssss> we are suppose to laugh at a situation where , they are now barred from because heigl is pregnant and mann is `` too old '' ? <sssss> and the 5 % quota for certain races ? <sssss> i felt sick . <sssss> this film was n't completely unfunny . <sssss> some of the scenes with the hollywood execs . <sssss> played quite well by kristin wiig and alan tudyk , were humorous . <sssss> `` this is hollywood . <sssss> we do n't like liars here ... '' . <sssss> even the title of this film is offensive to me . <sssss> i went because i loved the old virgin , and because it was reviewing very very well across the board . <sssss> instead , what i saw was a crass piece of work that has been done many times before , by a director who is capable of much much better . <sssss> if i were ever trapped with these characters , i would smile feebly and back out of the room asap . <sssss> what scares me is how popular this film is . <sssss> what does that say about us ? <sssss> maybe , this film is n't that influential in the long run . <sssss> but it definitely reflects the taste rampant in the throngs of people lining up to see this horrible film , for a second time , and declaring it the funniest `` comedy '' they 've ever seen . <sssss> i do n't think so . 
ur4234119/		\tt0097351		10		`` field of dreams '' embraces its own poetry with such that only one epithet comes to my mind : perfect . <sssss> the film pays a wonderful tribute to baseball , to what the game stands for in american culture . <sssss> yet i 'm not american and i remember how mesmerized i was by the story , when i saw it the first time with my dad , when i was only nine . <sssss> the reason is simple : baseball is the setting , the atmosphere , the of the story , but apart from that , phil alden anderson 's masterpiece speaks much more universal statements about life and dreams . <sssss> and when i saw it on that magical night , i remember we were both enthralled by the opening scene , when kevin costner was walking across his cornfield , and heard the mysterious voice whispering to him `` if you build it , he will come '' . <sssss> this line was probably the first i ever strongly remembered from a movie . <sssss> i believe this says a lot about the power of `` field of dreams '' : it has the kind of universal appeal that a child can respond to , the idea that the greatest accomplishments can indeed come from nowhere , that we all have some guardian angels guiding our actions and showing us the paths to take . <sssss> the dream-like escapism is magnificently incarnated through the breathtaking beauty of iowa 's farm , a vast landscape where the colors of the sky marry the sunlight in such a dazzling harmony that it 's a mystery that the film did n't get one oscar nomination for best cinematography . <sssss> anyways , when ray hears the voice , he does n't know what to do until a very explicit vision finally appears . <sssss> he understands the message , if he builds a baseball diamond , ` shoeless ' joe jackson will come . <sssss> the film goes deeper on the oedipal significance of jackson , who was the idol of john , ray 's father . <sssss> john kinsella was more than 50 years older than ray , and both hardly got any connection apart from their mutual love for baseball . <sssss> and it 's unfortunately through baseball that ray expressed his hostility by refusing to play catch with his dad and telling him that his hero was a criminal , referring to the white sox players who were banned when the world series was fixed in 1919 . <sssss> and the ` white sox ' scandal is the symbol of what the film is all about : lost dreams . <sssss> these eight players could n't play baseball for life , their only dreams were to feel the grass again under their shoes , to breath the wind blowing on the fields and to play , just play . <sssss> ray never did anything crazy or substantial in his life - he studied , graduated , lived the sixties , smoked pot , marched then settled in a farm - he believes this is a real opportunity to do something . <sssss> ray 's biggest fear is to end up like his father who never achieved anything , in a poignant bed conversation with his wife , played by amy madigan , ray decides to build a baseball diamond , no matter how costly it is . <sssss> and as silly as the idea sounds , his wife supports him , because she understands the value of marriage is also to encourage the one we love to pursue his dream . <sssss> naturally , the film evokes the financial problems and the repercussions on ray 's cornfield but the essential is what happens on the field . <sssss> and after a few months , when the first baseball player appears , when jackson -lrb- ray liotta -rrb- discovers the field , we know we 're unto something magical , never explored in any other film . <sssss> `` are you a ghost ? '' <sssss> asks little karin -lrb- gaby hoffman -rrb- with curiosity . <sssss> `` is this heaven ? '' <sssss> he asks in return before leaving for the night , `` no , it 's iowa . '' <sssss> replies an overwhelmed costner . <sssss> the baseball diamond becomes a sort of intersection between heaven and earth , the universal spot where dreams are fulfilled , when second chances are given . <sssss> as the film progresses , more and more players come to play , and ray receives new messages from ` the voice ' : `` ease his pain '' , `` go the distance '' . <sssss> a strange and curious odyssey leads him to an influential writer of the 60 's , played by james earl jones , and to an ex-baseball player who had only one game before he retired and became a doctor . <sssss> ` moonlight ' archie graham , now dead , would give anything to play baseball again , much more with his hero , ` shoeless ' joe jackson , but in fact , just playing the game . <sssss> burt lancaster delivers his last performance in `` field of dreams '' as doc graham , a man who did n't live wondering why he became a doctor , but what if he played one more time in his life , how thrilling it would be . <sssss> the doc is dead since 1972 but ray finds him while wondering in the streets , and then hitchhiking as a young rookie played by frank whaley . <sssss> at this point , we do n't ask questions , we do n't wonder why this or that happens , it 's all part of the same irrational logic , something guided by mysterious forces . <sssss> the voice , the vision , the ghosts , we accept them because they 're positive , because we feel something magical ought to happen . <sssss> and magical is an understatement , from the wonderful speech delivered by jones ' unique voice to the last encounter that gives the key to all the mystery surrounding the story , `` field of dreams '' ends with the perfect emotional pay-off to one of the most extraordinary journeys into the magic of sport , inspiring the best of human spirit : playing , sharing , connecting : you throw , i catch , giving and taking , the language of the heart in its purest form . <sssss> it 's not just one of the greatest baseball movies , but one of the best sports movie ever made . <sssss> still , there 's much more in the film . <sssss> there 's the idea that we all must pursue our dreams and tell people we love what we really feel , that no matter what they achieved or did n't , we love and care for them ... because as enchanting and inspiring as `` field of dreams '' is , it 's a fantasy and no matter what we build , some will never come . 
ur4234119/		\tt0248631		8		is it ? <sssss> in fact , more than the film 's characterizing food , lasse hallström 's `` chocolat '' symbolizes these little pleasures and delights that , once you taste them , make you inevitably wonder if it 's worth troubling over the mightier matters of life especially when it 's governed by the rigid hand of morality , when succumbing to the temptation or luring people into it , become a difficult , even perilous , mission . <sssss> `` chocolat '' is set in a french village with an unmemorable name , one of these ` once upon a time ' old-fashioned little places , whose people live according to tacit rules and codes that remained unperturbed for centuries . <sssss> it 's a village à la frank capra with a mayor , a priest , a grouchy lady , an old mourning widow , a lonely man walking across the street with his dog , a mad woman who hides a concealed wound in her heart , and so one and so forth . <sssss> and the village 's austere and apparently sinister stagnancy only calls for a stranger to break the morbid routine . <sssss> her name is vianne rocher , and the village , naturally , will never be the same after her arrival . <sssss> i wonder how the producers were convinced to make a film that exploits so many of the usual archetypes that nourished our classic knowledge , in a world that got so eagerly sucked into the progresses of technology , action and fast-paced thrillers . <sssss> indeed , when fairytale and sentimentality mostly belong to animation , `` chocolat '' 's presence feels as awkward as vianne 's in the village . <sssss> they probably thought that it 's today 's very audience that would need that kind of nostalgic escapism or that the film would never fail to touch the hearts , because the heroine is portrayed by juliette binoche . <sssss> and yes , as vianne rocher , binoche is the secret ingredient that gives the film its delicious flavor . <sssss> only binoche could carry the perfect mixture of alluring tenderness and enigmatic confidence , she 's not just the typical ` cute shop owner ' , she 's the embodiment of that sly wind blowing from the north , like a fresh air about to dust off the village 's preconceived ideas , and undermine the dominance of mayor comte de reynaud , played by alfred molina . <sssss> his antagonism with vianne starts with her inconvenient timing ; she opens a chocolate shop during the lent , much more at sunday hours . <sssss> his invitation -lrb- more like a polite coercion -rrb- to join the church forces her to reveal that she 's not religious , not married , which makes the existence of her seven-year-old daughter anouk -lrb- victoire thivisol -rrb- even more accusing . <sssss> and with her unusual lifestyle , fittingly red clothing and seemingly defiant attitude toward religion -lrb- despite its optimistic and good-hearted facade -rrb- , vianne does n't get the warmest welcome from the townspeople . <sssss> yet she 's ready to win each heart , one by one , all it will take is one taste from each one 's favorite chocolate -lrb- which she mysteriously guesses -rrb- to reignite a marital flame , or even draw a smile in the face of armande , her opinionated landlady , played by judi dench , the second perfect casting of the film . <sssss> armande 's bitterness is the sad result of a conflict with her overprotective daughter caroline -lrb- carrie ann-moss -rrb- who 's forbidden her son luc to visit his ` ' grandmother '' . <sssss> the chocolate shop soon becomes the refuge for armande and luc to meet each other and develop a secret bond . <sssss> the other subplots involve josephine -lrb- lena olin -rrb- who 's brutalized by serge , her drunken husband , the bartender played by peter stormare , and as expected , her growing friendship with vianne gives her enough confidence to stand against serge during a violent assault , when she finally overpowers him with a skillet . <sssss> thankfully , this is the kind of uninspired caricature that only works because the movie does n't get any further . <sssss> the film remains faithful to its initial tone , and never falls in the temptation to depict the religious townspeople as intolerant bigots . <sssss> and even molina remains closer to a more aristocratic version of hercule poirot than any other mustached villain ; he 's a man whose prejudices are rooted in marital troubles that led him to vent his anger on a free-spirited female like vianne . <sssss> but the film intelligently avoids the reverse that would have placed religion or men as the obligatory scapegoats . <sssss> `` chocolat '' is all about allowing one 's spirit to elevate beyond the limits dictated by a book , and find one 's own truth within the inner beauty of what life , or god for that matter , has to offer . <sssss> little anouk has an imaginary friend named pantoufle , a kangaroo with an injured leg , but it 's just an innocent touch to highlight that she 's inherited her mother 's mysterious sparkle . <sssss> a romance also blooms with the arrival of a group of gypsies , drafting along the river , among them the handsome guitar player named roux -lrb- johnny depp -rrb- . <sssss> depp 's chemistry with binoche never feels like a plot device : we do believe a woman who was so badly received would embrace newcomers with a more generous heart . <sssss> at the end , all the characters ' arcs close in an emotionally satisfying way , not always unpredictable , but it does n't really affect the enjoyment . <sssss> of course , it 's tempting to judge `` chocolat '' with more cynical eyes , but how about imagining how respectful to the audience 's sensitivity , the film remains ? <sssss> how one-dimensionally feminist it would have been if other women were victims of men 's abuses , how simplistically sentimental if a mother-and-daughter argument between armande and caroline had broken , while a simple look was enough to show that the two women finally made peace . <sssss> and finally , how dreadfully caricatured if an angry mob came to burn the chocolate shop ... well , i 'm grateful to the story for not having taken this path and yet kept the overall simplicity of its plot without depicting the villagers as a one-dimensional bunch , in a way or another . <sssss> the film 's spirit is magnificently conveyed by a catchy guitar tune , transporting us in a universe where benign and innocent temptations , open the pandora box where we can find the key to our own happiness . <sssss> too poetic ? <sssss> well , that 's another adjective that fits with `` chocolat '' . 
ur4234119/		\tt0110074		8		after watching `` the hudsucker proxy '' again , and reading roger ebert 's review -lrb- again -rrb- , i lamentably admit that i 'm totally out of words . <sssss> the film is so incongruously appealing that i feel my review should match the same level of creativeness and wonder it brought on the screen . <sssss> but seriously , what more can i say about the coen brothers ' `` the hudsucker proxy '' that it 's one of the best-looking comedies ever . <sssss> there are many moments in the film , -lrb- in fact , quite every time -rrb- where i felt myself wondering if i had to keep track on the story or my eyes on the dazzling looks it offered : from the beautiful panoramic shots of majestic and creepy like skyscrapers or the sumptuous recreation of the big corporations ' inside rooms with never-ending tables as vertiginous as the buildings , from a horizontal perspective . <sssss> roger deakins ' geometric cinematography is absolutely breath-taking and rather than being put for the only ` eye-pleasing ' purpose , works as the setting of some spectacular scenes . <sssss> the most notable one is the opening where the respected president , waring hudsucker , played by the late charles durning , decides to make the big dive , fed up of all that business mumbo-jumbo he had to endure his all life . <sssss> that long jump and long is an understatement -lrb- hudsucker even finds time to tell people on the ground to move away -rrb- , is weirdly convincing and hilarious through the anticlimactic slap at the end , the obligatory woman screaming and the verbal aftermath carried by heartless board members and their ruthless leader , sidney mussburger , played by paul newman . <sssss> the jump scene sums up the film 's appeal : it looks great and makes you laugh . <sssss> and naturally , if you 're a fan of frank capra 's classics where greedy corporate businessman use a naive and idealistic schmuck to fulfill some evil schemes , and all the subsequent archetypes : spinning on newspapers headlines , nosy and noisy journalists and the snappy wisecracking workaholic female who 'll get infatuated on the goodhearted fool she investigates on -lrb- tim robbins is perfect as the well-meaning norville barnes -rrb- , sidekicks and all that stuff , well , if you look at hollywood golden age with nostalgic eyes , `` the hudsucker proxy '' will be familiar territory for you . <sssss> and that capraesque touch clearly helps to appreciate the film . <sssss> indeed , that and approach constitutes a solid platform on which the improbability of the story can efficiently evolve . <sssss> and for some strange reasons , to which the coen brothers only know the secret , each actor , by playing his character in the required over-the-top way , gave them that touch of believability for the film 's bizarre poetry . <sssss> i concede it takes time to get into some characters , i for once , thought jennifer leigh was unbearable as the journalist , now , i ca n't see how her performance could have worked differently . <sssss> the point is not that she impersonated katharine hepburn or rosalind russell well or badly , but that she was ` impersonating ' . <sssss> it 's a film firmly aware of its ` ' . <sssss> naturally , the film is n't beyond criticism for all that . <sssss> many would argue that its very attention to great designs and magnificent looking details give a touch of seriousness inducing more serious expectations regarding the plot . <sssss> my agreement with ebert concerns the way the poster spoiled what would have been one hell of a twist . <sssss> i 'm talking of course of the circle that would be revealed as the hula-hoop . <sssss> that basic circle , norville barnes showed to everyone , adding the repeated line `` you know , for kids '' as if it was supposed to give a clue , could have been the film 's mcguffin since it 's the very device that triggers mussburger 's desire to hire barnes as the proxy , in order to depress the stock and buys all the company 's interests , but what a great surprise it would have been to have that revealed in the middle of the film . <sssss> apart from that missed opportunity , the film works and never leaves any hint of a dramatic evolution of the story . <sssss> and when drama , there is , it only plays as set-ups from some screwball situations , the opening with norville barnes trying to jump from the hudsucker 's high clock is a reminiscence of john doe 's character -lrb- gary cooper -rrb- in `` meet john doe '' , but i defy anyone to claim that he saw the resolution coming . <sssss> not to say that it would satisfy all the viewers , but still , it fits the film 's surrealistic touch to the film , with all flash and style , but not without substance . <sssss> granted `` the hudsucker proxy '' is n't `` metropolis '' , `` the crowd '' or `` brazil '' but by its stylistic recreation of these iconic setting , leverage our thoughts to the more satirical material . <sssss> maybe it 's too far-fetched , but i did n't think the film needed to speak explicit statement against savage capitalism ; the point is smoothly made without distracting from the slapstick and screwball material . <sssss> the assumption of ` all flash and no substance ' is n't totally irrelevant but with such flashy brilliance and such great dialogs , the film ca n't be branded as unsubstantial . <sssss> it 's classy , surrealist , and funny and much more , it succeeds to put all these qualities together , something a few films can pretend to achieve . <sssss> and on a more basic level , the film is so damn funny . <sssss> i laughed , i laughed a lot . <sssss> maybe not as much as in the first act , but the laughs were equally combined with true satire and a dazzling photography , served by superb performances . <sssss> the film works both on the surface and its content . <sssss> i wish i could say more , i wish my vocabulary would be richer , but all i can do is summarize the film by paraphrasing its repeated line `` you know , for laughs '' that 's what it is , a movie made for laughs , and the rest is just a delightful cinematic experience , something fresh made out of familiar material . <sssss> basically , the coen brothers did the same than norville barnes : they reinvented the wheel . 
ur4234119/		\tt0067549		9		addiction is such an incomprehensible phenomenon to those who do n't endure it , that making a film which portrays with such a gripping realism , not only the devastating effects but the reasons that push people to destroy themselves , is an accomplishment that deserves respect . <sssss> `` the panic in needle park '' , from the director jerry schatzberg is not only one of the most significant films of the ` new hollywood ' era but a slice of new york 's early 70 's life with an undeniable documentary value . <sssss> the film follows the lives of heroin-addicted people in the intersection between broadway and the 72nd , the only place outside harlem , where you could get the drug : sherman square aka ` needle park ' during a severe panic , which , in the business jargon , refers to a period where there 's no supply . <sssss> schatzberg 's direction is austere : no music , no innovation à la martin scorsese , only a camera following a bunch of young people in new york streets , confined claustrophobic houses , hospitals , sordid bedrooms but allowing us sometimes to breath in a green area . <sssss> the camera works as the eye of the viewer and i challenge those who 'd doubt the authenticity of the images not to cover their eyes during the close-ups , where you can witness a needle piercing a vein and injecting the stuff and all the immediate effects : rolling eyes , turning heads , licked lips , the horrific graphicness making you wonder why so much people fall in that spiral . <sssss> to answer this question , the movie needed to detach itself from its own tone , and provides a story ; it did even better with a romance , and quite a poignant and realistic one . <sssss> the characterization of bobby and helen is admirably handled by both kitty winn and al pacino , in his first starring role : you can see in very touching , yet subtle moments , the chemistry growing between them . <sssss> bobby is so cocky and fun , you know he overacts his own personality in order to seduce helen , and he 's so over the top , helen ca n't resist . <sssss> and whenever you doubt helen 's feelings , just look at her eyes , they tell everything and al 's eyes do n't say less : in the most poignant and defining scene , bobby plays baseball with a group of kids in the street , then turns a sudden look at helen , and realizes she took it . <sssss> a long and powerful silence follows and his reaction is a love gesture that definitely places these two characters in a warm place inside our hearts . <sssss> bobby understands helen 's act less as curiosity than a deliberate will to join his way of life , so both could be in the same wavelength . <sssss> it 's a tragic declaration of love , in the same vein than the romance between jack lemmon and lee remick in `` days of wine and roses '' , another great film about addiction . <sssss> of course , the romance takes a sordid course , leading us to the discover the junkies ' underworld and get all its tricks . <sssss> and you know the realism works when it mirrors some of your own experiences . <sssss> the film reminded me of my current addiction to the , or oriental pipe , and how the meticulous preparation provides a sort of before the consumption . <sssss> i take time to clean the water jar , to insert the body , to use some kleenex to fix the hose correctly . <sssss> it may sound ridiculous but this is what addiction is about , habits , and rituals that elevate you to early steps of pleasure until the final and rewarding pay-off . <sssss> and one day , i broke the bowl , i literally panicked and had to go at night to buy a new one because i needed it . <sssss> addiction 's effects reveal to be more vicious when the stuff is missing , driving you crazy to an obsessive point , and there 's nothing that can stop you once you have it hooked on mind . <sssss> but as a neutral documentary , the film is not about judging , condemning or even curing the psychological spiral of addiction but simply understanding it . <sssss> understanding why people rat , why women become hookers , why some crimes are committed . <sssss> addiction inevitably leads to a destructive alienation , where even death does n't scare . <sssss> every junky accepts this eventuality , and when one is having an overdose , there 's a disturbing mix of humanity when the friends are trying to awake him and hostility when the house who does n't want troubles . <sssss> bobby , helen and the others are all regular people , with families , babies , living in lively neighborhoods , but they 're caught in a horrific spiral that undermines any attempt of regular romance and the relationship between bobby and helen survives to all the difficulties , because their relationships is not totally disinterested : helen can get the heroin from bobby , and if he 's in jail , she can get it from his brother hank , played by richard bright . <sssss> and if bobby needs money , he can get it from helen 's hooking . <sssss> talk about a sordid romance 's basis , but the relationship is no less sincere and powerful in the way it makes us feel sorry for two pitiful and endearing characters . <sssss> and the acting is crucial here , kitty winn , who won the cannes award for best actress , is heart-breaking in this role , as her eyes , looks , cries and laughs convey the mix of vulnerability of a girl who still wants to be legitimate , and the toughness of the drug-addict who finally knows the ropes . <sssss> al pacino delivers one of his most brilliant performances as bobby , the street-wise , goofy dealer , who completes helen 's introversion . <sssss> both actors are wonderful , and a honorable mention to bright who illuminates his scenes , with a character so unlike the laconic al neri . <sssss> yes , it 's hard to believe both pacino and bright , would work together again in one of the greatest movies ever : `` the godfather '' , so if not for the beautiful romance and the extraordinary portrayal of new york 's , the movie launched one of the most successful movie careers and just for al pacino , i say : thank you , mr. schatzberg ! 
ur4234119/		\tt0081554		8		`` only art you can control , art and masturbation . <sssss> two areas in which i am an absolute expert . '' <sssss> anyone would immediately guess from which director is capable of such a hilarious line . <sssss> indeed , woody allen is a comedic landmark , the best american cinematic exportation to the european market . <sssss> and this is only justice since the roots of his comedic geniality , besides the humor , two filmmakers complete the european connection : federico fellini , the visionary and ingmar bergman , the introspective . <sssss> both fellini and bergman drove allen 's own contemplation of the world : while fellini explores the depths of one 's inner demons , lusts , and repressed impulses , bergman elevates them to their world , questioning the place of men within their own condition . <sssss> allen never denied these two influences but it was not until the pinnacle of his slapstick career that he made them more obvious . <sssss> allen 's tendency for homages could be foreseen in `` love and death '' , a hilarious historical film parodying some iconic shots of bergman 's `` persona '' . <sssss> `` annie hall '' and `` manhattan '' intellectualized the relationships between men and women , but it was `` interiors '' that provided the most proper cinematic expression to allen 's torments . <sssss> the film was a clear homage to bergman style-wise , but it was saying more about the conflict in allen 's own creative process , as if he was facing a sort of existential block , trivializing the achievements of the past , and questioning the of his work . <sssss> if not mocking , allen was questioning his own status as an intellectual clown . <sssss> he made people laugh , so what ? <sssss> this nothingness might even echo the dichotomy between `` art '' and `` masturbation '' , as if his oeuvre had no other purpose than satisfying an immediate , egoistical impulse , but leave nothing substantial for posterity . <sssss> through `` stardust memories '' , released in 1980 , woody allen is still stuck in his middle - career crisis , incapable to consider with objectivity the value of his work . <sssss> yet this time , it 's not bergman , it 's not the `` ego vs. rest of the world '' perspective that is underlined , but `` ego vs. subconscious '' . <sssss> for such a diagnosis , the themes developed in `` stardust memories '' mirror federico fellini 's `` 8 1/2 '' , the masterpiece chronicling the process of a film-maker 's own actions and their incessant interferences with the impulses , grieves , childhood memories and personal fantasies . <sssss> both movies are in black and white and the references are obvious , just like `` interiors '' that started with immobile contemplative shots of ` dead ' nature ; the very opening of `` stardust memories '' is an immediate reference to fellini . <sssss> woody allen , playing a fictional alter-ego director , sandy bates , stuck in a train full of sad-looking people , ca n't stand the suffocating atmosphere , forcing him to leave it immediately . <sssss> however , the comparison with fellini should n't undermine the review but only guide it to a better comprehension of allen 's motives behind the unusual format of `` stardust memories '' . <sssss> if one thing , the episodes are not disjointed and the movie is quite easy to follow ; in fact , it even suffers from being too explicit at times . <sssss> in one hilarious scene , bates implodes all his anger toward an alien presence , revealing his frustration not to be able to provide something more transcending than humor . <sssss> i had to watch the alien scene again , and i was quite satisfied with my previous review of `` interiors '' , which was expressing through a family crisis , allen 's own fears and dilemmas , and in `` stardust memories '' , they 're just thrown away with words , speeches , rants leaving no room for symbolism and creativity . <sssss> fellini created a deliberate confusion from which something genuinely creative graced the silver screen , and left the viewer with an optimistic feeling , a hope in art , as something that one can only control if he gets himself carried by his emotions and personal sensitivity . <sssss> in `` stardust memories '' , woody allen does n't paint a fantasy but take a photograph of his existential crisis . <sssss> he 's a successful comedic director , loved and admired , but the way he depicts his fans and groupies as a bunch of variously pathetic , needy , weird losers says a lot about the vision he has of his own success , something shallow and meaningless . <sssss> bates is just a man who pleases the crowd because he incarnates the inner sexiness of an ugly or nerdy man with humor . <sssss> allen is known to be a master of self-derision , in `` stardust memories '' , he sins by being harsher than usual toward himself . <sssss> yet `` stardust memories '' never gets too dark or pessimistic ; not only it maintains the comedic tone but keeps us hoping about allen . <sssss> if he does n't admire himself , probably putting himself lower than fellini or bergman , he does n't omit the role of women in his life . <sssss> `` stardust memories '' ' romantic undertones are essential because they demonstrate that allen , like every great man , has a woman behind him . <sssss> he 's attracted by the intellectual jessica harper , the sweet and maternal marie-christine barrault but ca n't get off the beautiful and sophisticated charlotte rampling , so brilliant she ca n't find the path of her life in a world full of interrogations . <sssss> allen can be a mentor , a baby , or stands on an equal cerebral footing . <sssss> the harmony he finds in his inspiration relies on his capacity to be that three-dimensional love - wise and therefore incapable to be satisfied . <sssss> in the same vein than `` interiors '' , `` stardust memories '' is a pivotal moment in allen 's career , maybe the film did n't meet the success because people expected something exuberant and flamboyant a la fellini . <sssss> ebert thought the film was frustrating because it was a depressing movie about a lack of inspiration . <sssss> well , allen is never as funny as when he 's pushing himself down . <sssss> he 's a man of contradictions , wishing he could make people take his humor seriously , but his vision of life is so full of fatalism , of absurdity , of an incapacity to find the right woman , that comedy remains the only proper medium to express his own disillusions . <sssss> so , paraphrasing a line from `` interiors '' , not only woody allen has the anxiety of a true artist , but he also has the talent , and both show in `` stardust memories '' .

<sssss> do the light and tunnel really exist ? <sssss> the subject fascinated me because i used to have my personal theory : many times , i 'm so sleepy i can feel the switch to the sleeping phase , whose sensation consists on my body floating over the room , in the dark , in a sort of sleep as if i was drowning into another world . <sssss> and when i focused my mind , i could perceive new images or even get back to the dream i wanted . <sssss> i 've always thought sleep could provide some of the most interesting insights about the afterlife , and maybe i wished `` flatliners '' would explore death like a dream-like universe . <sssss> the problem with flashbacks is that they make sense on a screenplay but it 's too rational for reality . <sssss> all memories involve sad events and traumas , and nelson 's experience has the most uncontrollable effects because he 's physically wounded by his vision , but the film is n't fantasy and does n't leave this plot point unanswered -rrb- , but all these traumas lead to too many convenient resolutions : it 's all about peace in mind and making amends . <sssss> it 's not that i do n't believe in inner demons or immanent justice , but it betrays the very the film was taking , as radically as the way bacon turned from an atheist to the most spiritual of the group . <sssss> the positive side is that it makes us care for the characters , they 're not just a well assembled cast meant to appeal to a young movie audience -lrb- not just that anyway -rrb- their transition from cocky students to resentful human beings works as a collective character 's arc . <sssss> but the film was supposed to place us in a position to question our vision of death , at the end , it was all about their vision of life . <sssss> i guess like all humans , i fear death because i fear the unknown . <sssss> i 'm not scared by nothingness , but by the possibility of its , which would be absurd , since nothing also includes ` no perception ' , but what if it could ? <sssss> what if our souls were really floating on the dark ? <sssss> can there be consciousness of nothing instead of nothing of consciousness ? <sssss> `` flatliners '' did n't appease my torments , as if its intellectual challenge was so ambitious , it finally surrendered to the common denominator of religion and philosophy : tending to what is moral when the truth and beauty are unreachable . <sssss> well , at least , the film 's conclusion is moral , and even poetic , but the whole challenge was to make the perception of the afterlife ` plausible ' , a pity the screenplay went to it the easy way . 
ur4234119/		\tt0060827		10		ingmar bergman 's `` persona '' rises above rationality with such beauty and self-confidence that if there ever was one word intelligible enough to translate the power of its images , the film would have failed . <sssss> i read many imdb users ' intelligent comments and although i 'm impressed by the literary material they used to look deeper into the film -- some philosophical references i unfortunately lack - i believe that if a film takes one book 's reading to get its meaning , then it missed something . <sssss> in my opinion , a film must only rely on what it shows and what the viewer perceives -lrb- besides , why should it require the use of another medium when it is already one -rrb- . <sssss> i saw `` persona '' three times and twice in the same week , and although i was tempted to get familiar again with the myth of electra or to read some articles written by freud or jung , i prefer to expose a view based on and only on what my eyes experienced . <sssss> and what an experience ! <sssss> `` persona '' is a harrowing journey within a very special relationship between two women , elizabeth , an actress who was playing electra and stopped talking in the middle of a play , and alma , the nurse who takes care of her -lrb- knowing that ` alma ' means ` soul ' in spanish would enrich this review , but i did n't know that -rrb- . <sssss> elizabeth is silent all through the film , with a few exceptions , and only her eyes and her body language express and hide her true feelings . <sssss> and if liv ullman is mesmerizing , it 's bibi anderson who deserves the praise as alma , one of the greatest female performances in my humble opinion . <sssss> alma is clearly fascinated by elizabeth , with this irrational veneration ordinary people feel for artists and all she does during the first act is speaking , telling her life , from the most banal to the most shameful secrets . <sssss> `` persona '' is made of monologues and silences , and the genius in bergman is to make it feel as dialogs , as if a human personality had unlimited ways for expression . <sssss> the tandem is not a one-way relationship : alma tells her secrets because she feels something in return , a sort of relief , of freedom to expose herself the way she is , but this very exposition , as the movie progresses , leads to its own limits . <sssss> basically , alma unmasked herself while elizabeth remained silent , incapable to reward alma for having opened her soul . <sssss> ` persona ' was the latin word for mask and in a way , it conveys the true meaning of a personality , which generally consists on the way it 's perceived by people , not necessarily what it really is . <sssss> elizabeth 's silence can be seen as a protecting her from alma 's perceptions , which inevitably hurt alma 's feelings . <sssss> this is where the conflict starts , and no great film can avoid one . <sssss> as abstract as it is , `` persona '' is surprisingly explicit about it . <sssss> alma incarnates the disarming effect of an overexposed personality , while elizabeth is the frustratingly quiet strength , strong but empty . <sssss> the two women end up fighting and not just symbolically . <sssss> the fight scene is pivotal because it shows that no one can lure himself into a convenient silence without being taken back to life . <sssss> yet , alma 's own regrets and insecurity proves that she needs to learn from elizabeth . <sssss> in `` persona '' , the conflict is even more gripping because we feel it 's necessary for the two women . <sssss> love is like a double-edged sword and as the two women become fond of each other , the fight , as an intimate -lrb- almost sensual -rrb- manner to express anger , becomes inevitable . <sssss> `` persona '' is a learning of , not within the film , but from our own perspective . <sssss> and the genius is that it does n't hide itself from being a film . <sssss> although , the beginning might strike some viewers as quite unusual , bergman is not making an exercise in style , the ` weirdest ' parts are very brief , some subliminal images might shock , but the film is short -lrb- less than ninety minutes -rrb- and allows us to distance ourselves from the characters . <sssss> bergman has his way with the camera ; he knows how to make the most subtle things incredibly accessible . <sssss> take the iconic shot of the film that inspired many parodies -lrb- including allen 's hilarious `` love and death '' -rrb- we see one woman 's profile and another woman with half her face visible , it 's like a mathematical view on life as `` one and one makes one '' , as if one personality was just the superposition of two faces , two states of minds , tragic , comic , the ` greek masks ' duality . <sssss> on that level , `` persona '' is also a triumph in film-making with a haunting , dreamy and hypnotic photography . <sssss> many close-ups reveal only half a face while the other is in the dark , but the shadow is not a representation of death , but fears , we hide what we fear , the most vulnerable spots of our ` persona ' , and while alma seems the more lively in the beginning , she 's hiding displeasing secrets . <sssss> and while elizabeth is in a communication 's blackout , she walks above existence , existing without being . <sssss> in one of the film 's most beautiful moments , the light slowly fades out but her eyes keep on scintillating , until you can see two white vivid spots in the dark . <sssss> elizabeth ca n't fool herself , she 's only alive with her past , her memories , and her weaknesses . <sssss> and when alma ca n't stand it , she makes elizabeth talking by threatening to burn her with boiling water ; it 's only by expressing her fear of pain -- anticipation of death - that elizabeth states her aliveness . <sssss> another moment shows her seeing on tv a buddhist monk burning himself to death . <sssss> elizabeth realizes that she also is plunging herself to a deadly state . <sssss> and alma is desperately trying to awaken her because the tragedy of life is that joy , passion and love can afford silences , smiles , kisses , sensuality , sex but man 's inner condition is made of doubts , pains , fears and weaknesses , and those can only be directly expressed through words , shouts , cries , voices ... ultimately art ... ultimately cinema ... ultimately ingmar bergman . 
ur4234119/		\tt0125664		7		when it comes to misunderstood geniuses or irreverent entertainers , milos forman is not the least interesting director for the biopic genre . <sssss> so , when he 's the one who handles the film relating the life and death of one of the most brilliant and misunderstood comedians of his generation : andy kauffman , portrayed by the greatest comic star of his generation : jim carrey , it ca n't get more promising than that . <sssss> the result turns out to be a very good film , with a little something that could have made it better . <sssss> i think that `` little something '' is easily and is to blame on the director , because basically , the movie lacked a direction . <sssss> it 's interesting that milos forman , an international film-maker - well , at least in his sensitivity - decided to make a film about an american tv and stage icon , someone whom a majority of people , even american , would n't be automatically familiar with . <sssss> think about this , mozart was an artist with an undeniable universal appeal , and even to those who did n't necessarily love classical music , `` amadeus '' worked as an extraordinary depiction of the poisoning effect of jealousy in the envious mind . <sssss> `` the people vs larry flynt '' involves a universe even more marginal but despite its sleaziest undertones , the films worked as an inspired pamphlet against censorship and any form of closed-minded bigotry . <sssss> and this is how a biopic should work , in my humble opinion , you do n't necessarily need a famous character , but you cleverly use his life , his personality as an excuse to speak much larger statement about human nature , i mentioned `` larry flynt '' when i could have evoked `` chariots of fire '' or `` gandhi '' . <sssss> or the movie should plunge us in the darkest depths of human nature , and enlighten us on the soul 's mechanism that can inspire a particular behavior that would influence a certain field , `` amadeus '' is one of them , but also `` ed wood '' . <sssss> and there is a virtuous effect on these two distinct approaches : when you transcend your character , you invite the viewer to question his own sensitivity and when you dig into your character 's sensitivity , you invite the viewer to transcend his own perception of life . <sssss> these are the two directions of a good biopic , higher or deeper . <sssss> i 'm afraid the direction of `` man of the moon '' is too ` linear ' . <sssss> exactly what is andy kaufman 's appeal for someone who 's never heard of him or never seen any of his skits even knowing his name ? <sssss> in its essence , `` man on the moon '' is trapped in its own concept . <sssss> i did n't watch the film as a fan of kaufman , which i ca n't be , because i 've never seen any of his acts , not even as a fan of carrey , but as a fan of forman whom i was sure , was going to make either a great film about the inner mechanisms of humor or a much greater depiction of the world of entertainment , like bob fosse 's masterpiece `` lenny '' who was also about a comedian i was n't familiar with . <sssss> but it turned out to really be about kaufman , well , i was n't cheated but i felt a little deceived . <sssss> the film is still good , but could it have really been bad since it recreates a succession of life 's episodes that are funny or intriguing indeed , with a documentary-like realism ? <sssss> hence the question , what did i learn exactly that i could n't have learned from a documentary ? <sssss> i feel guilty by writing these lines because overall , i enjoyed the film , hell , i ca n't even get the great drums moment and the catchy ` ' song off my head , the film needed more moments like the one in the carnegie hall , if not more intellectual , something more entertaining or appealing . <sssss> but it seemed like it only tried to please people who knew about kaufman and wanted to revive his short but brilliant career , a sort of sympathetic tribute from the buddies . <sssss> okay , but the material had so much potential , jim carrey 's performance was full of energy and poignant vulnerability and i appreciated danny de vito as shapiro , his manager , and paul giamatti as his buddy and co-writer . <sssss> the style , if we could even speak of style , of andy kaufman was an excellent demonstration of the power of humor , and how you can develop some comic out of it . <sssss> and the more i got used to the awkwardness of kaufman , the more i expected hints if not answers , why did he do that ? <sssss> why did people relate or not to that form of humor ? <sssss> maybe the film 's alibi is that it tried to play as a self-reflexive portrayal of kaufman 's style . <sssss> why should i expect some deep meaning from a film about a comic who did n't even expect laughs . <sssss> sure . <sssss> but kaufman , from what i understood , loathed indifference , and wanted to be either loved or hated , at least inspire a specific reaction from his audience , `` boos '' or `` cheers '' but never silence or `` meh ? '' <sssss> . <sssss> and what made the character so interesting is the way he seemed to be also insecure with compliments and cheers , as if he felt that the path to reach the comedic talent , never passed by cheap laughs , or classic styles , another reason why he detested sitcoms , with its prefabricated laughs . <sssss> he was indeed ahead of his time . <sssss> buy why was he like this ? <sssss> we 'll never know , and we all have to take his personality for granted . <sssss> i 'm not quite sure about the self-reflexive approach , because the film is not that subtle , i would n't have minded if it was longer enough to avoid the brutal ellipse from his childhood to his first act on stage , or show how courtney fell in love with him . <sssss> nor would i have minded if the film avoided some unnecessary gory parts that really did n't belong to the film . <sssss> the strength of `` man on the moon '' is that there is an inner fascinating charisma inhabiting the main character , and in a way the movie succeeded thanks to kaufman 's aura and despite the direction . 
ur4234119/		\tt0290002		7		in 2004 , half of the 10 highest-grossing movies were sequels to previous box-office winners released less than 2 or 3 years before : `` shrek 2 '' , `` harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban '' , `` spider-man 2 '' , `` ocean twelve '' and naturally , `` meet the fockers '' . <sssss> it 's also worth noticing that four of these five sequels were second installments . <sssss> obviously , you do n't change a winning recipe is a motto followed by many producers , and who can blame them in an industry driven by money and profit ? <sssss> but i 'm not trying to be cynical , not yet . <sssss> the reason i raise these statistics is because they prove indeed that the sequel of a good movie will always attract viewers , as if it was covering the marketing budget just by being a sequel . <sssss> the trick is to follow a pattern that succeeded and inject enough newness to surprise the viewers . <sssss> the point is to never get too distant from the original material and still be new . <sssss> well , that can work with plot-driven movies and linear narrative ; however , it 's more difficult to be original when a film is the continuation of a comedy , like `` meet the parents '' . <sssss> the original film was about being an outsider , about a clash resulting from a triangular love : greg focker -lrb- ben stiller -rrb- loved his girlfriend , pam -lrb- teri polo -rrb- , jack byrnes -lrb- robert de niro -rrb- loved his daughter , so both guys had to get along despite their different mentalities . <sssss> naturally , at the end , they both started to appreciate each other , the peace pipe was smoked and all went well that ended well , so there had to be another plot device for the , so after an exhaustive brainstorm they thought : how about discovering greg 's family ? <sssss> and the casting of dustin hoffman and barbra streisand as the fockers ' couple retired in hawaii , could only be encouraging . <sssss> the effect would be doubled , first we have to replay the games with equal rules , it 's time for good old jack byrnes to learn about the fockers ' customs and philosophy of life , and put in perspective his ` personal ' methods . <sssss> how someone who believes his daughter never had sex before marriage would deal with a sex-therapist ? <sssss> how would a constipated , man deal with spontaneous persons who believe in letting nature speaks , and people to follow their instincts ? <sssss> secondly , it would be exciting to discover what kind of parents could raise a boy like gaylord focker . <sssss> the problem is that the two premises cancel each other , the fockers ' irritate byrnes because they 're free-spirited , open-minded , everything he 's not , but that 's the way they are , and they never try to be something else , it 's mildly funny but it 's nothing compared to greg 's attempt to please jack that turns out to be disasters . <sssss> the second problem is that the parents are so optimistic , so jovial and upbeat , she believes in sex as the greatest medium of expression , he 's a lawyer who believes that winning is not the most essential thing , how could they end up conceiving a guy like greg . <sssss> maybe it was the only way to turn greg into the victim of both his parents and in-laws , following an unnecessary subplot where jack suspects greg to have a child with his former nurse -lrb- alana -rrb- , it does n't quite work , not better than the drugs allegations in the former one . <sssss> at the end , what is left to enjoy in `` meet the fockers '' is very communicative performance from dustin hoffman and barbra streisand and probably , one of the greatest performances ever , through the cute little jack who 'd learn one word from gaylord focker . <sssss> unsurprisingly , at the end , they marry , they celebrate the wedding , everyone 's happy , but nothing is much left to enjoy , it 's fun , but nothing else . <sssss> there was a true potential to let the differences between the byrnes and the fockers to escalate until the kind of confrontation where even the fockers would acknowledge some flaws in their education , something that would justify why greg is so ashamed of them . <sssss> there could have been a much more hilarious climax -lrb- literally -rrb- during the massage scene , but instead of having an orgasm , jack hurts his back again and gets upset . <sssss> so many wasted opportunities , but well , except for dustin hoffman and barbra streisand , the film does n't provide much more originality , except for the funniest part of the film , the opening where everything goes perfectly fine for greg , from the taxis to the airports , that was a clever way to put some distance from the original one , a pity that the rest did n't match it . <sssss> but i guess the first opus ' success asked for a sequel , even with declining quality . <sssss> did i mention `` little jack '' ? <sssss> yeah ? <sssss> so i guess it 's time to conclude this review . <sssss> . 
ur4234119/		\tt0116629		7		let 's get this straight , if only for the visual effects and the thrilling attacks sequences , for the iconic shot of the empire state building and white house blown to pieces , without any use of cgi but old good ` miniature ' material , `` independence day '' is a groundbreaking achievement that redefines the purposes of visual and special effects in the sci-fi genre . <sssss> and if only for that , the movie deserves a certain bit of respect . <sssss> but when you make such a big-budgeted action-packed blockbuster , and expect to impress the eyes of movie goers and make their hearts pound so hard that they forget to put their salty fingers in the popcorn box , why not make a supplementary effect to improve a script that would justify the use of these special effects , and not let the success of a movie rely only on a technological achievement ? <sssss> in `` independence day '' , it 's like roland emmerich was so confident over the success of his film that he did n't care much for the complaints that would be expressed toward the script and its blatant lack of originality . <sssss> and if it does n't take a genius to know that some formulas simply can not fail , it does n't take an elitist mindset either to find obvious flaws in the way the story is written , and maybe worse , in the way the characters are written , not portrayed because i think the actors did a satisfying job with what was at their hands . <sssss> overall , the humans were fine but how about the aliens ? <sssss> could n't have they come up with something fresher ? <sssss> i found hard to believe that these ugly octopus-like creatures could own a technology powerful enough to wipe out the entire human race . <sssss> well , never mind , the point is that i do n't buy the argument that just because a movie features spectacular effects , one must suspend his disbelief and enjoy the movie for what it is , especially when the most difficult stuff is perfectly handled . <sssss> i do n't buy the either that just because you criticize some elements of the plot , you 're some kind of movie buff with a precious taste and a particular dislike for mainstream movies . <sssss> i genuinely liked `` independence day '' , i enjoyed it and not just as a guilty pleasure . <sssss> i will never forget the experience in the movie theater when even as a 14 year old kid , i could n't help but cheer during the president 's speech . <sssss> oh some parts probably made me cringe , but it 's nothing compared to what was thrown to my eyes that night , it was a great year for action films , `` eraser '' , `` the rock '' but on that level , `` independence day '' was a class on its own , that till now , stood the test of time . <sssss> but the more i thought of it , the more i realize that i loved the experience much more than the story ... well , the result is pretty much the same , and the film was the highest grossing of the year but this indicates the main flaw on film like `` id4 '' , they leave as great an impression as a ride on a roller-coaster , but as ephemeral too . <sssss> their inner ambition is more to garner the most viewers than to leave an indelible mark on cinematic papers . <sssss> again , the team did a good job , but it just could have been so much better on the story department . <sssss> i do n't want to fall in the wisecracking trap by numbering all the clichés that structure the plot ; it would be a pointless exercise , because whatever plot was , it was relying on an overused concept anyway . <sssss> and the film features every single stereotypical elements so cherished by the disaster genre , a lot of social and racial backgrounds presented through the classic external focus with the maximum of diversity as to sustain the beautiful vision of america 's melting-pot . <sssss> in a way , it 's more economical to show all the racial minorities that constitute america than the whole world , america as the microcosm of the world . <sssss> hell , the liberation from the alien invasion even coincided with the 4th of july . <sssss> i hesitate between two words starting with p : pretension or patriotism , but when things are so obviously over the top , i guess it 's a more of a clever reminder than we 're only watching a film ... as if we had n't noticed before . <sssss> `` today we celebrate our independence ! '' <sssss> did that make me cringe as a non-american ? <sssss> not quite and i doubt the people in the theater pushed their thinking as far as i 'm doing right here in a totally different context . <sssss> in cinemas ' darkness , movies affect us more , creating a deeper connection with the protagonists , in that case , a charismatic country . <sssss> america entertains the world , and never is the empathy as strong as in theaters . <sssss> i remember how the crowd cheered during that speech , and while i 'm not sure people would look at the film the same way now , it makes me realize how these times were still innocent . <sssss> these lost years between the gulf war and the september 11th attacks , when nothing was as religiously and politically lauded as today , from every side . <sssss> i still look at the attack sequence with cinematically fascinated eyes , but i 'm still lucid about the way some people would consider , now , the sight of the empire state building 's explosion . <sssss> and i wonder if that works as a critic or an alibi for `` independence day '' ... world has become a very dangerous place by itself and maybe this is what makes the film an innocent and immature entertainment . <sssss> let just think that the real enemy for men is the alien , when it has come to men vs. men . <sssss> there 's even a sort of sentimental fatalism in the way it shows that it 's only in the case of alien attacks that humanity will join its forces and be united . <sssss> finally , if the movie ever sinned , it 's from a childish naivety ... or was it deliberate ? <sssss> or have we become just so mature that we changed our whole mindset regarding movies ? 
ur4234119/		\tt0051459		10		... and everyday i 'm drunk on this sour cocktail , asking myself : ` will i succeed or will i fail ? <sssss> if it was n't so theatrical , i could have sworn this movie mirrored my own life : a cocktail of fascination and disgust . <sssss> life is cold , bitter , with a detestable but somewhat invigorating taste , and it sounds like a jazzy score : entertaining when your eyes are closed but soulless when the windows of your heart are ... sincerely , i could have turned off the film just because i could n't buy the idea of a man refusing to have sex with such a babe like maggie the cat , elizabeth taylor at the everest of her beauty , even if this guy is the inducing paul newman , as brick . <sssss> i guess movies ought to challenge our perceptions . <sssss> maggie even wishes brick was ugly so she could at least console herself , but she loves brick , and ca n't get him off her mind . <sssss> they 're married , but he has n't touched her since a tragic event made her undesirable . <sssss> hard to believe , is n't it ? <sssss> who can even describe elizabeth taylor with that epithet ? <sssss> but that 's the point , when you realize how lying can be so convenient : let 's say that brick did n't desire maggie ... it might , it just might ... but is n't it too cinematically convenient ? <sssss> is n't there another hidden painful truth that could make it more acceptable ? <sssss> richard brooks ' adaption of tennessee williams ' play `` cat on a hot tin roof '' is a sensational immersion into the terrible condition to which life condemns us : a big and great lie . <sssss> who are we ? <sssss> people seeking happiness sure , but happiness implies some ounces of interest , we ca n't be happy without ` getting ' something . <sssss> to get ... now is that what life is about : getting , owning , possessing ? <sssss> the movie sweeps off these considerations by depicting this philosophy through the mentalities of people whose cynical visions go as far as considering a child like an added value more than a blessing . <sssss> there 's no room for abstractions in these southern bourgeois cultures , the illusion of happiness and comfort are even more important that genuine happiness . <sssss> so all we need is ourselves with impressions , maggie is pretty , brick is good-looking , they form a great couple , and that 's that ... but something obviously tortures brick , at a point the movie entered pop-culture with this iconic ambiguity . <sssss> the taboo subject is the death of his friend skipper , whom he always relied on , whether it was on a football field or in real-life , there was a symbiotic relationship as if skipper was a continuation of brick , his crutch . <sssss> both brick and maggie 's defensive reactions at the mention of ` skipper ' emphasize the idea of something more than a simple friendship . <sssss> well , we all know what it is all about , homosexuality is a recurring theme in tennessee williams ' plays , less as a voyeuristic plot device than a denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our societies . <sssss> mendacity is the word often used , i prefer to call it `` convenient lies '' , this sort of denial that maintains good relations to better destroy them in the longer them . <sssss> lies like a psychological blindfold we use to hide the true ugliness of things ... but is n't a genuine and sincere ugliness more tolerable than any convenient but hypocritical beauty ? <sssss> the subplot involving the illness of brick 's father , highlights our inner fear of the truth . <sssss> has n't it happened to you that you were so afraid of facing a situation you knew to be imminent to postpone it as long as you could ? <sssss> like a nihilistic approach to whatever could ruin your happiness . <sssss> big daddy , in a fantastic performance by burl ives , feels like resurrecting after having been announced that he would survive from his cancer , and at that point , acts as if whatever he built and gathered did n't mean anything , all that mattered was living , loving , getting a pretty girl etc. . <sssss> there 's a feeling of urge as if life was about fulfilling our dreams the fastest way ... but , when after a crucial discussion with his son , big daddy realized that he was indeed condemned , he went back to the idea that his son should behave better in order to earn the estate . <sssss> this precious estate cherished by his other son , gooper , played by jack carson and his wife mae , madeline sherwood . <sssss> but life is n't about stuff you own , nor love is about giving stuff , life is about immeasurable things : the stuff you have but ca n't get . <sssss> the film covers many taboo subjects , including sex before marriage , homosexuality , but the revolutionary aspect relies on the thought-provoking way it tackles the value of life through a character dying , and another , trying to hide his true personality . <sssss> hiding , lying , imitating , all these conveniences allow us to give a meaning to our lives , while our weaknesses , our secrets , our hidden desires , are the most solid constituents of our inner personalities . <sssss> we are what we try to hide , and the price for happiness is the reconciliation between us and the disturbing truths that constitute our lives . <sssss> as soon as big daddy resign himself to the idea of dying , he get truer to himself . <sssss> when brick admits his guilt in the death of his best friend skipper , the relief in his heart made him more conscious of the fragility , then the value of his existence . <sssss> facing and overcoming lies are the only ways to get closer to the inner truth . <sssss> it 's ironic how the movie ends with a big lie , but a sincere lie as it revealed something true boiling in the body of maggie , and able to appease all the consciences of the 's family , like a sort of deus ex machina that could finally let this tormented a family feel better ... finally ...

ur4234119/		\tt0032138		10		red like magical ruby slippers , yellow like a brick road to follow , green like the emerald city , blue like a cloudless sky , violet like a floppy field ... all the colors of the rainbow celebrate two magical universes with the same initials : cinema and childhood . <sssss> `` the wizard of oz '' is and will forever be associated with a magnificent imagery , unforgettable songs such as `` ding dong ! <sssss> the witch is dead '' , `` we 're off to see the wizard '' , the catchy `` if i had ... '' songs , the munchkins ' high-pitched voices , dorothy having the feeling ` not to be in kansas ' anymore , the shrill and scary voice of a evil witch and so on and so forth . <sssss> with all these elements , it 's comforting that the film lost against a worthy adversary , the iconic `` gone with the wind '' from the same director . <sssss> god , if there ever was a year where film-making triumphed , it 's 1939 , and the throne of hollywood undoubtedly belonged to victor fleming . <sssss> `` the wizard of oz '' is both a spectacular milestone for its first use of colors and groundbreaking visual effects and a timeless classic in the way it touched the heart of children from many generations , all over the world . <sssss> it 's fascinating how these two aspects drive the film 's paradoxical nature as the ultimate escapism , plunging us in the dreamlike technicolor vision of the enchanted land of oz , yet concluding with the immortal `` there 's no place like home '' . <sssss> `` oz '' captures through the innate power and insecurity of childhood a very poignant contradiction that reminds us how we used to dream of such places ` over the rainbow ' and still were deeply rooted to our home , our family . <sssss> and kansas , with its simplicity is dorothy 's home and we could n't be happier for her when she was finally back . <sssss> but as a set-up to this powerful finale , the whole film is a miraculous journey into a magical world where a group of friends will try to find the only person whose power could fulfill their wishes . <sssss> dorothy wants to go home , because she left her aunt worried after a frightening tornado destroyed the farm , the scarecrow wants to have a brain , the tin man , a heart and needless to say what the cowardly lion wants . <sssss> we all can identify with dorothy or her friends because each one remains true to one of the many emotions that inhabit childhood , fear , awkwardness , joy , sadness , homesickness etc. . <sssss> and watching these three adult actors and an adolescent judy garland taking their roles with such dedication is the best tribute to the good old days ' innocence . <sssss> those were the days ruled by walt disney and mgm 's roaring lion , when people went to the movie theaters to escape , to dream ... an even sadder desire when put in the tragic international context of the film . <sssss> speaking of my personal experience , i had `` the wizard of oz '' in mind long before watching the film , with the unforgettable image of dorothy and her three friends walking along the `` we 're off to see the wizard '' song , one of these indelible shots in the history of film-making that invites us to re-enact them every once in a while . <sssss> that 's the secret of `` oz '' , which makes any attempt to summarize the film pointless . <sssss> any other fantasy film can be more spectacular or penetrating but its popularity might mostly rely on the story , on the way it ends . <sssss> take capra 's `` it 's a wonderful life '' , the whole significance of the film depends on the reception of the last act of the film , and kind of diminish the impact of the first scenes . <sssss> in `` the wizard of oz '' , it 's all about characters , scenes , songs , quotes , each sequence is as valuable and impacting as another , and more than anything , each one conveys a valuable lesson about and for children . <sssss> whether it 's about children 's adoration for their pet animals -lrb- dorothy 's adventure starts because she wanted to protect her dog toto from the evil miss gulch -rrb- or about the value of friendship in order to face the adversity of the adult world , an undeniable pedagogical value elevates `` oz '' above all the other fantasy movies . <sssss> it is , for once , not a coming-of-age , but a story and a proud affirmation of the value of childhood in the way it intelligently mirrors our own memories of a time of misunderstanding , naivety , trust and fear and a perpetual leaning helping us to face the world , to accept it and moreover to accept ourselves -lrb- there 's a subtle message about self-acceptance powerfully conveyed by the wizard , played by the jovial frank morgan -rrb- . <sssss> and the merit of these lessons is to be learned through action : dorothy and her friends are never passive characters characters and that 's crucial because it puts action as a necessary step before learning , and fear , not as a flaw , but a necessary step before learning about courage . <sssss> `` the wizard of oz '' provides also through the wizard 's character , the man ` behind the curtain ' , a lesson about naivety and how child 's eyes can easily trust or be impressed . <sssss> in a way , it illustrates the sad reality that all the adults are n't trustworthy . <sssss> of course , some of them can be really mean and the film would n't have been half the masterpiece it is without the scene stealing performance of margaret hamilton as the wicked witch of the west , rightfully nominated # 4 in the afi top 50 villains . <sssss> the witch happens to be a representation of mrs. gulch in dorothy 's dream , like most of the characters , including the three friends -lrb- farmhands in real-life -rrb- and the wizard ... in a way , it helps us to keep in mind that dorothy is only dreaming , which does n't make her dream less impacting anyway . <sssss> and bizarrely , as we forget it 's all a dream , we cease to be marveled by the beauty of the cinematography and the special effects , forgetting that it was before cgi , before `` star wars '' , that 's the miracle of `` the wizard of oz '' , and as a beautiful dream , its memory can be eternal ... 
ur4234119/		\tt0372824		9		`` the chorus '' has something special that miraculously cuts straight to your heart , whatever it is does n't belong to our cynical days . <sssss> but the ` miraculously ' word is less a praise than a simple recognition of value . <sssss> `` amelie '' for instance , is a far superior film in my opinion because at least , it had the merit to be original , something that cruelly lacks in `` the chorus '' . <sssss> i almost blame myself for being so familiar with `` goodbye , mr. chips '' , `` blackboard jungle '' , `` to sir with love '' or `` dead poets society '' , the theme of the schoolteacher struggling with rebellious pupils and then helping them to find a meaning to their lives is so old that i wonder how christophe barratier got away with this from the french critics ' circle . <sssss> roger ebert was less magnanimous in his review . <sssss> i reckon ebert was about to convince me , just before i started to question my criticism . <sssss> after all , even the most unoriginal plot can make a creative and surprising film . <sssss> moreover , barratier , the director never denied that the film was an adaptation of a forgotten 1945 classic named `` a cage of '' , which basically uses the same plot . <sssss> christophe barratier was so touched by the story that he felt it deserved to be known by the 2000 's audience . <sssss> and thankfully , he did n't kill off the charm by setting the film in a more recent context , and consequently being very careful about the use of this or that minority not to inspire the same kind of negative reactions `` amelie '' faced . <sssss> `` the chorus '' is a film set in the france of 1949 , a totally different country who was still healing its wounds from wwii . <sssss> and in the france of 2004 , as it often happens in this country so thirsty of intellectual discussions , the film opened the door to an unexpected wave of nostalgia towards these days where discipline and authority was the daily bread of pupils , whose childhood took its full meaning because it was not spoiled yet by technology . <sssss> kids had to learn about respect , yes , but they had the freedom to play with what was at their hands without tv , without the internet . <sssss> tougher times but so much more appealing , and maybe that 's why parents and kids both loved the film , and why it became a subject of many social debates highlighting the reality that discipline and authority were still relevant today . <sssss> `` the chorus '' was a phenomenon , released at a time where the audience was probably tired of having so many french thrillers emulating american films with a certain level of violence and spectacular scenes that did n't fool anyone . <sssss> it touched a sensitive chord in france , then europe and even across the atlantic , because of the universality of its subject . <sssss> we all had a teacher who inspired us , and the film is a tribute to this optimism that inhabits childhood , this idea that anything is possible , and that it is never too late to find a meaning to your life . <sssss> still , the ` miraculously ' word is not about the elements i just described , it 's something more than that , something transported by a series of unreadable signs translated by the most beautiful and universal human language . <sssss> that is the real secret of `` the chorus '' : the music . <sssss> it 's so magnificently composed and written that it succeeds precisely where others cinematic elements do n't . <sssss> indeed , the same story with the same actors , director and characters would n't have such a great phenomenon without that music . <sssss> i ca n't describe how the melody of `` look to your path '' affected me , and the people in the theater . <sssss> that 's the power of the film , as it brilliantly embodies the magical power of music , this capability to let yourself escape from your condition , and open the windows of your heart to an infinite road made of dreams , projects and inspirations ... the film is about hope , optimism , life and this is what the music , hence `` the chorus '' is about . <sssss> the music works as an antidote to all the cold intellectual approach that would point its finger on the unoriginality of the plot . <sssss> yes , we know that clément mathieu -lrb- gérard jugnot -rrb- , the underdog and not pleasant-looking music teacher will succeed , yes , the way the kids turn from average singers to a talented choir , flirts sometimes with cinematic fantasy . <sssss> yes , we know what will happen to pierre morhange -lrb- jean-baptiste maunier -rrb- . <sssss> but it 's like the film embodies itself the touching naivety of childhood incarnated by the cute little face of when he says he does n't know any song , with his nose cutely moving . <sssss> okay , we wise guys , have seen many films like this , but how about the others , how about kids ? <sssss> should our cinematic knowledge always undermine our appreciation ? <sssss> should we always blame a film for being manipulative even if it manipulates us to something undeniably positive ? <sssss> so , i 'll give it a 9 , not because of the predictability of the plot , but just for some little flaws in the writing that could have been avoided . <sssss> how could n't the older morhange remember the name of the man who changed his life , for the best ? <sssss> why trying to depict these kids as incarnation of the devils where they are not -lrb- after all , mr. chips ' kids were not all bratty -rrb- ? <sssss> why making such a despicable character out of rachin , the headmaster , especially after depicting him in a lighter way just before ? <sssss> the movie needed an unlikable bossy civil servant but not an evil man . <sssss> and last but not least , in the farewell scene , why did n't mathieu take all the sheets that went sent to him ? <sssss> there are many interrogations left but these ones still bug me whenever i watch `` the chorus '' . <sssss> still , it 's indeed one of the most memorable films of the 2000 's , that anyone from any country would love , english , american , french ? <sssss> forget about it , the movie speaks the most universal language , i mean ... it sings it . 
ur4234119/		\tt0099088		9		and here comes the conclusion of one of the finest and most likable cinematic trilogies : `` back to the future part iii '' , more than a sequel , a in the spirit that made the first film such an endearing classic , with an even more escapist value in the setting , the far west during the 1880 's . <sssss> as a sci-fi family romantic comedy , `` back to the future part iii '' is already a winner , but the western is the defining aspect of its originality . <sssss> `` back to the future part iii '' was directly made after the second , basically recycling the same material , and using the same team , the same casting etc. . <sssss> the continuity between the two films is so determining that there 's no way watching the second without getting immediately to the third , it 's like keeping in touch with the same family . <sssss> indeed , as much as i can watch the first one alone , because it 's a class on its own and a film i consider slightly independent from the two sequels , on the other hand , i consider the sequels too connected to each other not to be seen in a row . <sssss> this continuity helps to appreciate the second part that feels more like a link between the two other films while `` part iii '' resurrects the spirit of the first one by focusing on the emotionality rather than the eternal `` back to the future '' mission . <sssss> this has always been marty 's preoccupation and the thrust of the trilogy but the travels also had the merit to solve some familial issues and help a beloved character to improve something in his life , if anything , the trilogy defines the notion of ` coming-of-age ' as the inspirational aspect of the film , its encouragement for success through self-improvement . <sssss> but since people were facing less materialistic issues than during the 80 's , i guess there was a need to take some distance from these so-called philosophies of successes and a huge step back one century earlier when the 80 's followed the secession war and preceded the industrial revolution that would lead to demise of the frontier spirit . <sssss> the far west is less a setting or an era , than a state of mind , embodying the roots of the american spirit in its purest form , before greed and profit perverted its meaning . <sssss> the far west setting perfectly fitted the tormenting desire of doc emmett brown for retirement and a tacit existential quest for love . <sssss> consequently , while the central character of the first film was george mcfly and the second part focused on the mcfly family , gale and zemeckis took the last film as a great opportunity to enrich the character of doc brown and close his story 's arc through a love story in order to replace the `` mad scientist '' label by a necessary element of three-dimensionality . <sssss> on the surface , marty 's mission is to prevent brown from being killed by the villain who -- for our greatest delight - is biff 's ancestor , buford `` mad dog '' tannen , but while marty and doc try to find a solution to push the delorean to 88 mph , destiny puts them in clara 's path . <sssss> so doc meets clara clayton -lrb- mary steenburgen -rrb- , a teacher whose fate was to fall in the ravine canyon and give it a posthumous name . <sssss> at that point of the trilogy , we 're all aware of the time travels ' mechanisms , we can even be surprised by marty 's incapability `` to reason '' , who he traveled so much . <sssss> but here , the film invites us to put all the scientific stuff into perspective and think of the real elements that our fates . <sssss> there 's a strong philosophical material hidden behind the love story as the film concludes its approach on time travels with the idea that nothing is written except by our free will and our capacity not to let external elements direct our lives . <sssss> but i may make the film sound too intellectual when it 's also a great comedy and one hell of a western . <sssss> the film is the opportunity to rediscover and say goodbye to the wonderful characters of hill valley , to see the first in american land , to witness the inauguration of the clock tower which , as doc said , was fitting that he and marty could witness , not to mention marty pretending to be named clint eastwood , at the risk of tarnishing this name by becoming the biggest yellow belly in the old west . <sssss> and the delight on the comedic level is in the way the humor works on a level as if the film was breaking an imperceptible fourth wall , playing on its own trademarks . <sssss> i ca n't resist to the scene where marty , realizing that he might be killed instead of doc utters a `` great scott '' followed by doc 's comment `` i know this is heavy '' , when marty wonders why they always have to `` cut these things so damn close '' or when , in the most dramatic situations , he reacts by an ironic ` perfect ' . <sssss> and speaking of dramatic , the film also provides great thrilling moments you 'd expect from a western , and probably the most heart-pounding climax from the trilogy with the train sequence , so suspenseful , i remember i had to pause for seconds the first time i watched it . <sssss> this was one of the few times , i needed to take a break because it was just too suspenseful , but what a fitting and rewarding conclusion . <sssss> action , escapism , duels , stage , rides , indians , cavalry , `` back to the future part iii '' is also an independent homage to the western genre with some exhilarating moments , served by alan silvestri 's terrific score , probably his best work in the trilogy . <sssss> and this is why i consider `` back to the future '' as the greatest trilogy after `` the godfather '' with a slight advantage that remains the consistency in terms of spirit , thrills , laughs and emotional value . <sssss> so thank you robert zemeckis , bob gale , michael j. fox , christopher lloyd and all the team for these three unforgettable classics !

ur0774754/		\tt0366777		8		a small , lonely boy 's world is turned upside down in millions , the latest from director danny boyle , whose striking visual style is not unlike his contemporaries , tim burton and steven . <sssss> while he has had his share of misses like the beach , he has also struck gold with definitive genre films like trainspotting and 28 days later . <sssss> here , he continues his success with this family oriented gem based on a fine screenplay by frank cottrell boyce -lrb- hilary and jackie -rrb- . <sssss> after the death of his mother , damian and his family move to a new english suburb . <sssss> there , he and older brother , anthony , go to school and begin a new life with their father , ronnie . <sssss> as damian struggles to fit into this new existence , he is also fascinated by historic saints . <sssss> one day as he plays by the railroad tracks in his cardboard box of a playhouse , he is visited by a saint who foreshadows a gift . <sssss> suddenly a bag comes tumbling down and destroys his paper home . <sssss> within the bag is a very , very large sum of money . <sssss> what to do with this windfall from the heavens ? <sssss> damian begins to do the right thing , namely to help the poor as he is counseled by numerous saints while his brother is more interested in using the money to buy things and better his life . <sssss> damian 's charity giving begins to attract unwanted attention when he makes a rather hefty donation to a school sponsored charity event . <sssss> the charity 's female representative , dorothy , takes a liking to damian and his father who takes a romantic interest in her . <sssss> meanwhile , a mysterious stranger appears by the railroad tracks looking for the money . <sssss> it turns out that the money may not have been from the heavens but from a more , shall we say , illicit venture . <sssss> the stranger becomes a viable threat as soon ronnie and dorothy learn of the boys ' loot . <sssss> all of this occurs as england is ready to convert to the euro dollar which means the money will become useless unless it circulates or gets exchanged . <sssss> as the family decides how to properly dispense or dispose of the money , the stranger is ready to collect . <sssss> such is the stuff of good storytelling with a moral bent . <sssss> alexander nathan etel is quite a find as damian with his portrayal of the pure soul of a young boy who not only misses his mother , but wants to help the world . <sssss> lewis owen mcgibbon is equally good as the older but not necessarily wiser brother . <sssss> a good supporting cast lends credence to the unusual proceedings . <sssss> the various saints are all well depicted without seeming to be silly . <sssss> the film feels almost like a fairy tale with touches of fantasy and longing . <sssss> it is intimately told from a child 's point of view . <sssss> it is intriguing how the story could easily have focused on different threads such as the female charity rep who becomes involved with the father . <sssss> but because this is damian 's story , the film wisely stays on course . <sssss> the saints who chat with damien throughout the story serve as his advisers , mentors , and even protectors . <sssss> are they real or a figment of his imagination ? <sssss> it really does n't matter as the story does indeed move forward and the sense of urgency is never lost . <sssss> there is an elaborate action scene told in flashback which could have been a film unto itself , but boyle uses it as exposition without losing sight of his protagonists . <sssss> in fact , the story never loses sight about the importance of love and family . <sssss> one sore point for american moviegoers will be trying to understand the dialogue . <sssss> once you get acclimated to the thick british accents , you can enjoy the film in earnest . <sssss> the depiction and use of saints as part of the storytelling may draw some to accuse the film of a deliberate religious slant , but it really is a kind of fairy godmother or angel multiplied into several . <sssss> there is nary a preaching of theology or church when you come down to it . <sssss> although a child 's tale at its core , there is a threatening presence -lrb- by pg standards -rrb- from the stranger who lends a dark mood once he appears half way through the film . <sssss> although it contains its share of drama and sentiment , it also has some genuinely funny moments without being cheap . <sssss> there is also a climactic moment of connection and resolution that will resound in every viewer 's heart . <sssss> it is interesting to note that boyle 's thinly disguised altruism and politics are on display with his subplot on providing water relief for an african village . <sssss> but that does not take away from the innocence and purity of a boy 's vision . <sssss> this is a film that , despite its family themes , does not fall for easy sentiment . <sssss> it earns its feelings and emotions . <sssss> this special little film about a small boy and simple themes has a very large heart . 
ur0774754/		\tt1152836		7		johnny depp is hitting his stride in recent years with his pirates of the caribbean films and character roles . <sssss> director/writer michael mann has been a respected stylist of the crime genre with such notables as heat , thief , and tv 's miami vice . <sssss> the union of these two super talents results in a more than satisfactory retelling of the legendary bank robber , john dillinger , in public enemies . <sssss> this violent tale focuses on the free spirit of dillinger and his infamous robberies in the midwest at the height of the great depression . <sssss> in 1933 , the country is in the midst of the great depression and bank robber john dillinger -lrb- johnny depp -rrb- captures the public 's fascination and even folk hero worship . <sssss> having helped to break his friends out of prison , he continues his robberies in and around chicago . <sssss> as the crime wave sweeps the midwest , the fbi 's j. edgar hoover enlists up and coming agent , melvin purvis -lrb- christian bale -rrb- , -lrb- who has just nailed pretty boy floyd , -rrb- to capture dillinger , public enemy number one . <sssss> purvis employs a variety of sophisticated listening devices and police work to track him . <sssss> dillinger thinks he is invincible and executes even more daring bank robberies . <sssss> he dates hat check girl billie frechette -lrb- marion cotillard -rrb- and travels with her to florida for horse races and then to arizona , where lawmen recognize and arrest him . <sssss> transported to indiana state penitentiary , an easier place to breakout than a federal prison thanks to his mob lawyer , he uses a fake gun to engineer an escape . <sssss> he is joined by notorious hothead robber , baby faced nelson , and they score more violent robberies . <sssss> purvis insists on recruiting a crack force of texas lawmen who assist him in closing in on the dillinger gang leading to a memorable shootout in little bohemia . <sssss> as dillinger crosses the state line , he violates federal laws and brings pressure on organized criminals , who turn on the fugitive . <sssss> billie 's fear that john will be caught or killed is tempered by her love for him , and when she is captured by local law enforcement , purvis intercedes . <sssss> when a call girl comes forward with information about dillinger , purvis sets up a fateful ambush at the biograph theater where the fbi will be waiting . <sssss> it is interesting that dillinger 's relationship with organized crime syndicates helped him with a legal infrastructure that disappeared once the mob deemed him a risk to their lucrative business . <sssss> further , hoover 's political agenda was desperate to make headlines and build the fbi into a future powerhouse of law . <sssss> it is also fascinating how technically proficient the fbi was on its use of wire taps and eavesdropping devices while being relatively incompetent in conducting a simple arrest or taking part in a shootout . <sssss> what is refreshing is the core romance between dillinger and billie frechette . <sssss> dillinger is presented as bold , charismatic and at times ruthless . <sssss> it is his bravado that attracts fellow criminals and billie to him . <sssss> cotillard gets a strong role that is considerably more than window dressing . <sssss> her performance is convincing , and her chemistry with depp 's dillinger makes this romance believable and heartbreaking thus lending an emotion subtext to the typical gangster movie . <sssss> bales 's purvis is portrayed as an obsessed , determined lawman who is dry and dull in sharp contrast to the devil may care attitude of the freewheeling dillinger . <sssss> billy crudup registers effectively as the young hoover . <sssss> mann favorite stephen lang , barely recognizable , registers a solid performance as a hardened texas lawman who is critical to the end of the film . <sssss> besides the usual set designs and costumes to mimic the depression era , heavy use is made of period music . <sssss> the little bohemia shootout is a major set piece with heavy use of hand-held cameras . <sssss> although a detailed montage of action , it still does not have the visceral impact of john milius ' dillinger or even the classic , g-men . <sssss> there is also an extended bank heist reminiscent of mann 's heat in its boldness and precision of execution . <sssss> the climactic ambush at the biograph theater is depicted in excruciating detail and still carries a great deal of tension . <sssss> the last scene at a women 's prison may never actually have happened , and it is curious that lang 's lawman and not purvis serves as the catalyst for this key moment . <sssss> the subsequent , final shot of cotillard after getting a special message is quite memorable . <sssss> it almost raises this film to another level . <sssss> public enemies is not the best of michael mann , but it is a solid entry in his canon of crime films . <sssss> what is notable is another star turn by depp , an actor at his creative peak . 
ur0774754/		\tt0425123		7		ghost stories involving romance are a recurring subject matter in hollywood . <sssss> case in point , one can look at the ghost and mrs. muir , heaven can wait , somewhere in time and the most recent entree , just like heaven , a modest romantic comedy featuring attractive leads , reese witherspoon and mark ruffalo . <sssss> while reasonably entertaining and diverting , it does n't quite deliver the goods . <sssss> elizabeth -lrb- reese witherspoon -rrb- is a workaholic doctor in san francisco who drives to meet a blind date on a rainy night and swerves into the path of a truck . <sssss> weeks later , we see david -lrb- mark ruffalo -rrb- who is searching for an apartment when a circular , advertising a vacancy , literally finds him . <sssss> upon moving in and settling down , david is surprised and spooked by the appearance of elizabeth who claims she already lives in the newly rented space . <sssss> she mysteriously vanishes and reappears , and david is convinced that she must be a ghost . <sssss> yet she refuses to believe she is really dead . <sssss> as they figure out the truth , david and elizabeth find they are attracted to one another . <sssss> when the reality of what happened to her that rainy night is revealed , david must resort to desperate measures to save the girl he loves before it is too late . <sssss> directed by mark waters , who showed promise with comedies like mean girls , this is a film that wants to be more than it is . <sssss> it aspires to be a lighthearted , romantic love story with dramatic and comedic overtones . <sssss> that 's pretty ambitious for a script -lrb- adapted by peter tolan and leslie dixon from marc levy 's novel , if only it were true -rrb- that would be better off on television . <sssss> the themes are pretty familiar and have been done before and better . <sssss> the filmmakers could have tightened the first hour and the pace would have been improved . <sssss> at times , the plot line comes dangerously close to losing whatever momentum it has . <sssss> it takes a long while for anything to happen , perhaps too long . <sssss> however , the climax does pick up steam as the relationship between the two develops , and one just wishes there was more such life in the earlier stages . <sssss> to be sure , there are nice touches in the story that allude to fate , coincidence , and true love , but the script does n't draw the connections as magically as one wishes . <sssss> then there are the technical inconsistencies that even audiences with suspended disbelief may have a hard time to swallow . <sssss> we see elizabeth pass through walls and tables but why can we hear her footsteps on the floor or why can she sit in a truck without falling through ? <sssss> granted , the special effects , while not earth shattering , are interesting and reasonably imaginative . <sssss> it is also clever how the editing alternates between the ghostly elizabeth and reality where no one sees or hears her except david . <sssss> these point of view crosscuts when david is talking to elizabeth even as the public sees him talking to no one are at times amusing . <sssss> the two stars do have nice screen chemistry together . <sssss> reese witherspoon -lrb- legally blonde , election -rrb- is watchable in almost anything she stars in , but she can only breathe so much life in a standard storyline . <sssss> if mark ruffalo -lrb- collateral , you can count on me -rrb- gets hold of a great comedic script , then you 'd definitely have something to utilize his versatility . <sssss> after successful pairings with witherspoon and jennifer garner in 13 going on 30 , how about teaming him with rachel mcadams or even drew barrymore ? <sssss> here is an obvious case of star power being enough to overcome an average script . <sssss> as comedies go , it really does n't climb to great heights , but the leads are so appealing , it really does n't matter . <sssss> a sure video rental , it is a pleasant bit of fluff that will certainly appeal to those who believe in true love and fairy tales . <sssss> to the rest of the audience , just sit still and smile with your date .

ur10986404/		\tt0090180		8		there are a lot of comments already for this film , which for some reason i 've missed until now . <sssss> so rather than reiterating massive plot details , i 'll simply give my overall impressions . <sssss> also , not watching csi , i was n't familiar at all with william peterson . <sssss> this film has more mayhem than the `` dirty harry '' and `` french connection '' films , combined . <sssss> and chance , the lead cop makes more wrong turns and experiences more consequences of his misguided actions and wrong than dabney coleman in `` short time , '' or clouseau in all his films . <sssss> -lrb- and dabney , as a cop near retirement , with medical test inaccurately saying he was dying , wanted to get whacked in the line of duty so his son could benefit from the major proceeds for his college fund ; so his goofy actions were intentional . <sssss> -rrb- as i noted in one comment here , there certainly are no sympathetic characters on either side of the law here -lrb- or in dean stockwell 's lawyer , who pretty much straddles these -rrb- . <sssss> willem dafoe is the main `` bad guy , '' playing it with a sort of laconic menace , no stretch for him . <sssss> peterson 's `` chance 's '' total obsession in pursuing dafoe seems over-the-top to a large degree , and it costs others a great deal along the way , including - in the big car chase - probably more auto accidents on the freeway than even l. a. would normally encounter in several months . <sssss> but i nonetheless found it engrossing , and viewed now gives a view of the 1980 's movie techniques and music , which would be different today . <sssss> and with the deaths and injuries occurring , at least the lack of sympathetic attributes on the part of the characters provides less disturbance than one might sustain normally .

ur10986404/		\tt0043014		10		like many things , some movies can be described as a `` whole which exceeds the sum of its parts . '' <sssss> this film is one of those - and `` parts '' can reference both the general description as in the term , as well as those `` parts '' played by the cast members . <sssss> gloria swanson overplays her character -lrb- nothing new for ms. swanson -rrb- , as one would expect from the faded , silent-screen , delusional actress she portrays - and in view of the fact that overacting was more prevalent in the era during which this picture was filmed , especially those in the film noir genre . <sssss> however , gloria not only chews the scenery like an avid beaver , but like a whole colony of them . <sssss> erich von stroheim looks as though at any moment he will be joined by dr. frankenstein and igor . <sssss> william holden -lrb- outstanding in so many roles , from `` the moon is blue '' and `` stalag 17 '' onward -rrb- , and nancy olson , make june and ward cleaver , or the bradys , look like deep , mysterious couples . <sssss> but in spite of all of this , the movie is , as a whole , interesting and fascinating , not just when viewed as it would have been contemporaneously , but as a true relic of a film now over a half-century old . <sssss> whether this is because of - or in spite of - the performances is the question to be answered . <sssss> i believe it is the latter , but whichever , it is well worth seeing . 
ur10986404/		\tt0086465		10		i saw this film again for the time in a while - and enjoyed it every bit as much as previously . <sssss> although now with a bit of `` age , '' its jokes and situations have well , and are still as funny . <sssss> besides , when you see a movie such as this again , several more years since its release , you get some added bonuses . <sssss> you see eddie murphy and dan aykroyd , early in their careers , and jamie lee curtis of two decades ago , along with the aging ralph bellamy and don ameche , who , along with the two excellent supporting actors -lrb- denholm elliot and paul gleason -rrb- are no longer with us . <sssss> the comedic scenes and lines all remain thoroughly enjoyable and humorous . <sssss> -lrb- towards the end , where they all dress in elaborate costumes and assume characterizations for the train ride - this is a bit much . <sssss> they only had a few hours for their travel arrangements plus arranging these outfits - and to arrange for such costuming , say , for a big party , would take a week or two alone . <sssss> but it provided comic interludes , set-up turning the tables on the `` bad guy , '' and gave the leads a chance to gnaw a bit of the scenery . <sssss> -rrb- movies where characters encounter identity changes or switches , and where two opposite types are juxtaposed , are nothing unusual - but this picture captures this better than nearly all the others i 've seen . <sssss> and i 'm certain that this film assisted eddie murphy in his giving the great performance of the `` '' characterization in the also outstanding `` coming to america .

ur0680065/		\tt1228987		6		owen is a lonely boy being bullied at school . <sssss> he meets abby when she moves into the building and a friendship grows between them . <sssss> but as a series of murders occur , it becomes apparent that abby is hiding a secret ... she is a vampire . <sssss> of all the film reviews i 've posted on the imdb site , let me in is a film i never wanted to review . <sssss> not because it 's a bad film , it is n't , but because of how i feel about let the right one in . <sssss> in my opinion , let the right one in is the best film of the last ten years . <sssss> when i heard of this new version , i was filled with anger at it being remade so soon , and dread as remakes of horror films have on the whole been pretty poor . <sssss> i mean for example , the wicker man , the ring , a nightmare on elm street , the hitcher , when a stranger calls , prom night , dark water , and many others have all been terrible compared to the originals . <sssss> but to confuse the matter more , was the fact that let me in was being produced by the resurrected film company hammer . <sssss> this was to be their first cinema film released for over thirty years . <sssss> hammer in it 's original company , made some of the best horror , fantasy and science - fiction films ever made , and made my own favourite horror film of all time , dracula . <sssss> so were does let me in sit ? <sssss> well lets start with the positives . <sssss> the casting of kodi smit-mcphee and chloe moretz was inspired . <sssss> both of them are very good in the central roles of owen and abby . <sssss> they are fast becoming two of the best child actors in hollywood at the moment , and both are brilliant here , especially kodi smit-mcphee . <sssss> the rest of the cast are pretty good too with the likes of richard jenkins and elias koteas giving strong supporting performances . <sssss> this version of the story , follows a similar pattern to the film version of the original novel more than the novel itself . <sssss> as a result , like let the right one in film , it strips out a lot of back-story and subplots , to concentrate on the relationship between owen and abby , and when they are on screen , the film works very well indeed . <sssss> but where the film goes wrong is in some decisions made by matt reeves as writer and director . <sssss> for instance , changing the way the jenkins character , known only as the father , goes after victims . <sssss> reeves has decided to make the scenes almost like inserts from a different serial killer film , with the character hiding in the back of cars waiting to pounce on the victims . <sssss> also there is the strange decision to never show owen 's mothers face throughout . <sssss> she is only seen in blurred image , or from the neck down or from behind . <sssss> i 'm not sure why reeves wanted to do it this way but i do n't think it fully works . <sssss> as for owen 's father unlike the original book and film we never see him at all , instead reduced to a voice on the phone . <sssss> this is a shame as i always felt that the visit to the father was a key scene in both book and film . <sssss> the most disappointing thing overall though is the violence and bloodshed in the film . <sssss> the attacks abby carries out involve cgi which i was disappointed with . <sssss> i suppose they were trying to show abby as some kind of animal when attacking , but the cgi is poor indeed . <sssss> as for the bloodshed and violence , there is more of it here than the original . <sssss> to my mind this is only because the film-makers felt they needed it to grab the audiences attention , something the original never resorted to . <sssss> in let the right one in , attacks were shown from a distance away from them , never in close up . <sssss> it 's a change i did n't feel was needed . <sssss> a key change reeves had made is in the decision to use a cop -lrb- elias koetas -rrb- investigating what is going on , instead of the group of friends from the book and original film . <sssss> while this does keep things going , the friends in the story played a key part and are missed . <sssss> it also means when the victims are attacked they are faceless unknowns , instead of characters you care about . <sssss> i have to say also the music score is poor . <sssss> it feels like a generic horror score , making it almost instantly forgettable and lacks the haunting quality of the music from let the right one in . <sssss> i hate comparing let me in to let the right one in , but it is unavoidable for one simple reason : reeves chooses to repeat certain scenes from let the right one in almost exactly the same . <sssss> this means of course you end up comparing the versions , and sadly let me in is n't as good as let the right one in in this comparison . <sssss> and note , this is not another version of the book as was claimed during the making of this film . <sssss> it 's another version of the film instead . <sssss> let me in though is still a much better remake than most that have been made recently . <sssss> and if you have not seen let the right one in , you may enjoy this film a lot more . <sssss> but having seen the swedish original film and having read the novel , i have to say it 's not as good as the source novel and film .
